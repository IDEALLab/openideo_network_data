I know the \"one-click\" was about the ease of use and access, but I thought I'll share this thought with you.

As a non-American it is difficult for me to justify expressing some opinions. It is the collision between security and privacy that sets up the tension in the process. The system needs to know who is entitled to vote and that they have voted only once but the individual requires the system respect the privacy of their actual vote. In that regard the current paper ballot based system used in most places works pretty well. - if you can be identified on a list of eligible voters either by giving your name and address (as happens in Australia) or presenting an acceptable form of ID then you are given a blank ballot, practically indistinguishable from every other ,that you can mark (in relative privacy) and place in a sealed container (with relative anonymity). Identification/verification must be linked to avoid multiple voting - I have about 10 polling places within 2 miles (5km) of my house, this is highly desirable from the point of view of accessibility but highly contentious if the system did not record the fact that I (the identifiable individual) have cast a vote and only one vote.\rAs to the separation between recognition of entitlement to vote and the private act of voting current at booth practices achieve this very well, the challenge is to acceptably achieve it in circumstances where voting is moved away from defined and controlled polling places, especially online.\rWhile my thinking in drawing up this concept may have been muddled with regard to the variety of American elections I, personally, am still of the opinion that creation of a national voters roll (database), by amalgamating and rationalising the county,state or other voting rolls that already exist would add flexibility and increase accessibility to the voting process.\rWhether people think a National Voting ID Card is a good idea will depend in part on ideology (including the civil liberties question) and in part on practicality. I, like the majority of Australians, ideologically rejected the Australia Card (National ID Card) but have since realised its practicality compared to the alternatives now in use here. America too seems to have rejected a National ID for the time being but other countries, Morocco, Spain, Sweden, India (to list a few I know of through this challenge), have embraced or are embracing one.\r\rTo return to my original thinking about this concept I am simply posing the question - would having a national roll or a national id card (for voting purposes) increase voter choice of polling places and therefore improve accessibility for all )including those with disabilities)?", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "February 29, 2012, 01:16AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "national_voter_roll_vs_national_voting_id_card", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Paul, Excellent analysis of the tension between needing to be able to identify the voter, but keep the vote secret. \r\rYou are right that there is not a national ID card in the US.

As I started looking into this, I was very surprised to find out how many people don't have one of the types of ID that are often a stand-in, such as a driver's license. \r\rYou are also right that a voter registration system that was more centralized would offer more choice of polling place.

That's not a good situation to vote in. \r\rHaving information read in audio form is a great example of a feature that would help many people, for many different reasons. It's one of the advantages of a universal design. If they audio information was \"just there\" anyone could use it whether they needed help with vision, reading, translation, or just prefer to hear information.

But if going to the polls is the barrier that stops someone from voting anyway, that experience is irrelevant to them.  Moreover, it is just so much easier and more physically accessible to vote online, and I bet you are right that more people would vote if we made it as easy as doing it from your computer at work or home.  \r\rMy question is if we do move to a completely online voting experience, does that mean that we are by default going to lose the social aspect of going to the polls on election day?

(This, in particular, was cited by some I interviewed as a confusing process, especially after moving to a new community.)  And, most importantly, a van can travel to rural areas where lack of transportation resources often hinders community participation.  For example, depending on paratransit (which is notorious in many areas for being unreliable), a ride from a friend, or a bus can lead to feeling pressured at the polling place. People are afraid they may miss their ride home if voting takes too long, or that they are inconveniencing the person who is giving them a lift.  \rI have one suggestion  which has been mentioned by others.  There are many mobile medical units out there that travel to hard to reach areas.  Im most familiar with ones that provide regular primary care to children in rural or economically depressed urban areas, or disaster areas. It might be possible to place a voting specialist on board at regular intervals to register, answer questions, or even help cast a ballot.  Vans also provide a wonderful grass roots opportunity to learn about the locations of local populations in need, which may have been overlooked.", "user": "9b9a675bba225644aa0e456f1b87258c", "date": "March 21, 2012, 03:51PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "voting_vans", "applause": 3, "user_url": "", "text": "I want to give a shout out to the OI community for their amazing feedback that helped further this concept!

The reason why I thought that it would be important to have (most) people to go to the polling place in the first place because I read some articles (also on the network) saying that more people are likely to vote, if they are seen being an 'active citizen'- in a public space, voting with their peers. \r\rWhile I do agree that someone could use this program also at home, and send their device through the mail... I feel that the general public should embrace the importance of taking the time to go out of their house to vote. I wanted to try and think of an experience that is a transition between physical paper voting and digital apps... and is more involved and carry more work/significance than our daily cellphone networking apps. I think keeping voting on a reserved day, having voting in a public space, as well as keeping the vote a physical tangible thing- retains its significance in our completely-digital world today.\r\rI thought about eliminating the device, and downloading an app, but I assumed that general public or elderly:\ra) don't have access to download the app via internet (with low tech phones) \rb) don't really know how to download apps\r\rThe other main reason to have the box device (similar to square) is exactly what you said, to make things fast and controlled... I feel that a lot of naysayers to the 'digital voting' in machines is that they don't really understand/believe that their vote is not going to be tampered with. Maybe they aren't accustomed to the digital age yet, but I think it's a valid point. They perceive today's electronic apps/programs as just an invisible cloud of information that may get tampered with if they don't really see the result of their vote ( unlike dropping a paper ballot in a physical box). \r\rThis is also why I considered using a device platform that is physical- So that people could see these devices being dropped into a box, and it also acknowledges and embraces our country's process to collect votes physically. \r\rThanks again for your comments, I'd love to know what you think!", "user": "bea492294642e966c6649e8d925f3566", "date": "February 26, 2012, 07:43PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "ballot_box_device_adapt_to_voter_s_individual_cell_phones", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Great conversation you've triggered here, Mei.

Now I am planning to let voters (conscious consumers) select the way they vote through the app or the website a week or two before they go to the polls. This would give them the time to take a look at the possibilities, and save time during elections.\r\rMy second concern is that a voter might not even be able to use a computer alone. However, in those cases there is usually a family member assisting the person in need. So the profile or voting method can be filled by them, still enabling the voter vote by himself in the end.\r\rFinally I thought that this app, running in smart phones, ipads/tablets, in web browsers, or ATMs can be announced and used two weeks before the elections. \r\rThe app starts by selecting one of these three options\r\r1. I am a voter\r2. I assist a voter\r3. I am a poll clerk\r\r1. If one selects 'I am a voter,' then he can be given several information on voting polls, candidates, that he wants to vote from home, etc.\rBut I will focus on that he can select  either A) the way he wants to vote, such as selecting a different language, a way to input and output B) or he can create his profile by marking, for instance, that his ears do not function C) he can select 'I need a poll clerk to do all this'\r\r2. In a scenario where the voter is not able to use this app alone at all, then usually a caretaker or a family member assists the person in need. Again a week or two before, this person selects 'I assist a voter' and the app helps this assistant login the voters details, similar to the first option. The assistant might also know exactly what the voter prefers (such as that her blind son needs an audio guide); and still, the app lets the voter vote alone when the election time comes. \r\rThe benefit of these first two scenarios is that, when the voter comes to the voting poll, and logins using their national ID card, the profile is already created and the voting method is set. If a voter did not login beforehand, then he is set automatically to 'I need a poll clerk to do all this'\r\r3.  'I am a poll clerk' gives a poll clerk all he needs. He can do his poll clerk training, tips on treating handicapped, his work schedule, etc. He logins with his ID, so the system knows he is a poll clerk, gives more options than a regular user.\r\rI will focus on that he can fill in voter profile and the app can help him suggest the voter how to vote (just like in the old scenarios). Although the first two options help 'conscious consumers, in this case voters' select their needs, it is not mandatory for a voter to use the app before the elections. The poll clerk should always be ready for a surprise case voter to come to the poll.\r\rFor instance, two poll clerks can visit a hospital with an Ipad and help particular case voters vote using the app. Imagine that Minjun realizes his eyes do not function at all any more, right the day before the elections and he is in a hospital! A poll clerk can change his voter profile and help him with the most appropriate way of voting.\r\rI hope you can give me some feedback so that I update the concept asap:) I do not want to lose focus, so I am not sure if these three options are a bit too broad?\rIn the end the core idea of the concept has been 'to use existing digital devices to create different ways of voting using different ways of input and output' The app is of course the user interface side of all that...", "user": "aef124e5213d69dc35733683ab0e10e9", "date": "March 16, 2012, 11:47PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "diversity_in_voting_let_the_app_suggest", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "I like your three options.

I am sure the complicated training they have to go through can be turned into a much more interactive and easy to use process!\r\rBuilding a public online app is a good idea. It can involve info on the candidates, polling places, asking for a personal assistant beforehand, etc. Keeping the same interface, the app can be developed to be used any internet browser, or be implemented to smart phones. The Accessibility Map is brilliant! Imagine that a voter is looking for the polling place and the app directs him to the nearest location using the GPS system.\r\rI am a bit worried about letting voters decide on which method of voting they prefer. The core purpose of the app is to help select the most appropriate way of voting for a particular person in a fast and not troublesome way. Why would the voter bother to learn about all the different voting methods and try to figure out which fits him most? Imagine a person with no obstacles, why would that person spend time on this beforehand? Plus, how many different voting options should be there for people with no obstacles? In case there is an option to chose, then there should be sufficient number of options..\r\rWell, now a question with an assumption..in case choosing your own voting method is important, then, how can it be attractive to people, even to the ones who neglect voting in the first place? To chose 'the voting method that fits you', a voter can be given a psychological quiz like in girls magazines: 'Which animal are you?' or 'What celebrity do you match with.' Now it sounds very lame, but the test could be fun and useful; it can analyze if the voter understands more text based information, audial, or visual..\r\rHowever, I still think the voting process should be kept simple. Instead of giving the time and energy on deciding on the best method of voting, a voter can be given more interesting information on the candidates. The app can decide on the voting method if one logs in the necessary information. Also, some things can not be predicted beforehand.

I have been reviewing some literature on the issue, and decreasing voter turnout has been attributed to a number of different causes. One of these causes being, of course, that some people do claim to not have enough free time. There are a number of socio-economic and cultural/hereditary factors,  factors that play a role in election day behavior as well. Voter turnout tends to be higher for presidential elections than it is for state legislative elections. \r\rAlso, the best predictor of whether or not you will vote in an upcoming election is whether or not you voted in the last one, indicating that voting behavior might be able to be taught/learned as a habitual behavior. This statistic also highlights the need to target and encourage young voters to get out and vote for building strong voter turnout in future elections. If you can get people engaged in the electoral process early, it seems like that behavior generally maintains itself over the course of a citizen's lifetime.", "user": "081cbcaf0242d3572460a9b7635917ba", "date": "February 10, 2012, 04:38PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "ease_of_election_experiences_fostered_by_activism_on_campus", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "The polling booths were set up as part of a collaborative effort on behalf of the university administration and clubs representing Democrats and Republicans on campus.

Although on the some levels this does not affect much, it does affect a lot of the specifics.\r\rThere is really no such thing as a \"national election\" in the US. All elections are run by the states. So voters only register once for any election, from federal down to the most local issues. It's just bottom up rather than top down.\r\rFederal laws set some national standards(notably HAVA and the Voting Rights Act), but with a few exceptions the federal Election Assistance Commission offers advice and guidance, which the states may adopt. It also distributes national funding to the states to implement accessibility under HAVA. One of the important roles of the EAC is being a central point of communication for best practices and shared resources. \r\rIn the states, elections are administered by the counties. The relationships between the state and county election offices varies - some states have strong state offices; others don't. \r\rSo: voter registration rolls are maintained by the counties. The first step of modernization is at the county level. Some states are already moving to a state-wide database. Obviously, this affects the degree of flexibility in choosing a polling place. \r\rI should also point out that counties (and polling places) vary in size, depending on the density of the population and geography.

An election official asked for ideas about how to help his office and poll workers work with people with disabilities more effectively. One suggestion was to include them on his team. Many government offices have internships, and of course they all have staff.\r\rOne theme I hear in many accounts of the experience people with disabilities have in elections is that the workers are trying to be helpful, but may not have the tools and the knowledge they need. \r\rIt makes me think of two questions:\r\r- How can we help elections workers provide better support?\r- How can we involve people with disabilities more in running elections?\r\r\rBy the way, in the US, citizens are hired as poll workers for election day.

Then it would be like making appointments for a check up. My instinct (which may be wrong) tells me that people with accessibility issues are likely to be reliable in keeping their appointments.\r\rSecondly, part of the skill of a doctor's receptionist is to establish if a patient will need a long or short appointment, and is one reason for having the receptionist control the appointment book. In the context of voting the making of appointments will, to some extent depend need. Ashley's questions about online booking raise issues about being able to identify the voter, their specific need and how long the appointment should last. There are various ways of addressing these issues and in solving them it should be possible to minimise misuse.\r\rFinally (for now) part of my concept (voter traffic reporting) is based on knowing approximately how quickly voting is happening, how many people there are in the queue at the moment so people can know, if they turn up at the polling place in the next ten or 15 minutes, approximately how long they will wait. The proposal is to have this information online but also displayed at the polling place so people already in the queue have an idea of how much longer they will wait.\r\rI am now adding reference to your concept (in mine) in the facilities information section whether, or not, a polling place uses appointment bookings and in the links section telephone and online appointment links (as if your concept is already a reality).", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "March 04, 2012, 01:22AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "find_out_book_your_time_slot_", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Paul,sounds great .

You need to work out the analogy for reversing (or preventing) a fraudulent vote.\r\rOne possibility: All mobile phone votes become provisional votes, not counted until after the signature has been checked.  They get timestamped, and if more than one comes in from the same voter, they all get flagged for special attention.  Perhaps the voter gets contacted and asked to come in to verify which signature is really theirs, in case staff can't tell from comparison with the signature on file.  If there's more than one with a truly valid signature, the one with the earliest timestamp is the one that's counted.\r\rOf course, when a credit card number is stolen by a store employee, they also have access to your signature, as it's on the slip that the merchant retains. I could imagine someone being paid to capture an image with their cell phone, and the buyer having access to an expert forger.

Since it is a Saturday the school can be dedicated to the purpose - car parking is generally adequate and often such activities as car washes, cake stalls and sausage sizzles take place. When families vote together common culture dictates that only one person need stand in-line if the queue is long.\r\rI am particularly interested in your general online booking system which as AL says complements Mamta Gautam's idea of voter appointments \r( http://www.openideo.com/open/voting/concepting/find-out-book-your-time-slot-/ ). \rI shall build on your system in my (complementary) concept to smooth voter traffic \r( http://www.openideo.com/open/voting/concepting/mapping-accessability-rating-and-traffic-reports./ ) \rwhich at present is only geared to knowing how many are already there, how quickly people are voting and therefore approximately how long the wait is.\r\rAnother thought has just struck me too - you could choose to get an SMS/email/online alert (as a paid service) if too many people make a general booking 'after' you - say if, when you book only 10 people are in the online bookings but you n eed to know if the bookings grow to more than 50 people.

In classical Greek, however, the root is the verb for casting or throwing; indeed, we cast ballots, but the Greeks did not read this word as requiring that they be round balls. In ancient Athens, votes were taken by issuing clay or metal tokens to each voter, and the voter would vote by depositing the appropriate token in the appropriate ballot box, or perhaps in a clay pot that served as a ballot box.\"\r\rSource: http://www.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/voting/pictures/", "user": "59ce4f71e16c7f4f27abffcca4d3d39c", "date": "January 27, 2012, 06:57AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "what_s_in_a_ballot", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks, Daniel.

Besides being more convenient for many voters it also extends the choice of available polling places (particularly schools) that have the room to set up sufficient private space to vote, usually have adequate parking, often have appropriate and adequate wheelchair access etc.\r\rOn the question of queues there is a huge amount of research on queuing (of which I have no specific knowledge). From experience the issue seems to be tackled in many ways. Once upon a time banks (here) had a separate queue for each teller now there is a single queue, sometimes supported by a ticket machine that establishes your position in the queue but allows you to sit and read while you are waiting or perhaps even go outside again and await the call to transact your business (such ticket machines have been included, in various guises, in other concepts and inspirations.\rWhere you gain an established place in the queue it tends to relieve stress a little. If you miss your cue to collect a ballot, perhaps because you needed to take a child to the toilet, you are not penalised by going to the back again but only by losing a few places in the queue.\r\rWhat if instead of having to present identity to receive a ballot you presented it to receive a ticket & reserve a place in the queue, then presented the ticket in exchange for the ballot? \rFurthermore, if in presenting your identity you could establish special needs, the 'system' could allocate you a number already recently used to move you near the head of the line. I dont know real figures for US polling stations but, for example: \rSuppose you present your ID to receive your queue ticket and the next number would normally be 157 but your record on the roll (or on your ID) indicates special needs - if, at that time, clerks issuing ballots are processing numbers 123 through 135 (and assuming all prior numbers have been processed) the 'system' could issue you a number like 119 which would place you at the head of the queue to receive a ballot.\rThere are now 2 queues one (resembling an ordinary queue) to receive a ticket which reserves a place in the second queue according to need. Turnover in the first queue would be much quicker than in the existing system whilst the second queue becomes dispersed for greater comfort and benefit.\rI shall float this idea in Team S.O.Y.'s concept of Comfort Waiting (see AL's post here),  Stefan Ritters Priority Queues (same reference) and build on it in my concept for Reporting Voting Traffic \r( http://www.openideo.com/open/voting/concepting/mapping-accessability-rating-and-traffic-reports./ )", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "March 04, 2012, 04:19AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "rethinking_election_queues", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Actually on reflection I might float it as a complementary concept as well.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "March 04, 2012, 04:29AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "rethinking_election_queues", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "On rereading this concept I think some of the other points you raise like signage at different points in the queue might be better managed with a 'dispersed queue'.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "March 04, 2012, 04:45AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "rethinking_election_queues", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Nice thinking you guys.

(I've actually been a pollworker in two different counties, which is unusual.) \r\rThe smallest voting district is a precinct. A precinct may have as few as 500 registered voters or as many as 3000-4000. Ideally there is 2000, and typically there are 4 people who serve the voters of that precinct on election day. (What each of the four people do is actually different from county to county.) For each precinct, there may be 3-5 voting machines.\r\rAnyway, I have worked an election day in which there was only one precinct in the room. Obviously in that situation, this concept is superfluous. \r\rBut I have worked an election day in which there were 15 precincts in the same room. It so happens that the voting machines could be programmed to be used by any of those 15 precincts so the middle of the room was full of voting machines, and the tables where the pollworkers sat lined the edge around the center. In situation like this, there is often a table at the front of the room with pollworkers whose job it is to direct the voters to their correct precinct. \r\rThat's the type of situation in which this concept is quite suitable. The fact that the voter has to go to the exact precinct even though the machines can serve all of them is is an anachronism of habit and law. With minor changes though, this idea could work quite well. (Keeping in mind that the one disadvantage of large groupings of precincts is that it requires voters to travel further to vote. The single precinct I mentioned above was walkable by many voters, but in the massive 15 precinct grouping, located in an industrial area of my suburban/rural county, driving was a must.)

In the 15 precinct county, there was only one pollbook, which held things up considerably. Moreover that county assigned the job for the entire day, as opposed to allowing us to rotate jobs.

Of course, holistic can cover many things, such as groups of voters, geographies, disabilities etc. What I was trying to convey in this post is that holistic also means looking at the 'softer' side of design (i.e., mindsets and behaviors of individuals), so for example, if you look at other places where organisations have to provide a great service to many different types of people (arguably a part of what you are trying to do in the voting process), such as hospitals and hotels, many of the great examples you can look at have a heavy focus on these 'softer' elements (e.g., Ritz Carlton (the international hotels group) have a rigorous process to recruit, train and mange their staff, and have some innovative approaches, such as each member carries a card reinforcing that 'Guest Satisfaction' is their highest mission - it is titled \"We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen\" - which helps to create mindsets and behaviors that are in line with the business strategy, but more importantly are applied consistently across all locations.).

I've lived in NYC and cash still plays a big role there. It doesn't here in Ohio. In NYC little shops get persnickety about taking cards on small transactions,but that's rare here. In NYC the waiter almost always delivers one check to the table, whereas here waiters more likely assume that they will be delivering a check for each person at the table than not. The point being that many people don't visit ATMs here, so they will be making a special trip. \r\rOn a related note, in NYC you can turn a corner and see a little room with half a dozen bank machines and across the street there will be another little room with half a dozen bank machines. We don't have that here, even in our most dense urban areas. I'm typing this from my parent's house, which is a 15 minute drive from town, where there are 4-5 banks, and each one only has one machine (always a drive-up machine.

Is that code unique to that voter (so that only the voter can unscramble them) or is the code universal so that anyone can unscramble the ballot? If so, what does scrambling achieve?\r\rSmall addendum--because write-in candidates are found on ballot, the ATMs used will also have to have touchscreens--so that write-in candidates can be typed in by the voter. (Most new machines are that way, so that's not a big issue.)\r\rFinally, one thing to take into account is how long each machine will be used. I uploaded a sample of a ballot that I had in 2008 (it's at http://www.scribd.com/doc/86050712/Sample-ballot-Franklin-County-2008) \r\rIt's a pretty lengthy ballot, and it would be entirely reasonable for a person to take 10-15 minutes to vote it. \r\rIf you're annoyed with my points, take heart: look closely at the ballot linked and you'll see my name as a candidate.

We spent about 55 million on electronic voting equipment here in Ireland around 2004 - a huge amount for a small country of 4 million people. The equipment was not fit for purpose, and is now being scrapped. \r\rI get frustrated when people say 'We've all used ATMs for users, so we can't we vote online'. There is one major difference between ATM transactions (and most other online transactions) and voting. Voting must be anonymous. A secret ballot is the cornerstone of any democracy. It must not be possible to connect a vote back to a voter. \r\rBut there is also a contradictory requirement for the vote collection and vote counting process to be visible secure and reliable. I haven't come across any technology solution that provides this anonymity along with an open, transparent, secure vote counting process. The systems that do exist generally rely on complex cryptography which is not understood by the vast majority of the population. So people are expected to trust in something that they can't understand.\r\rIn many of these debates, the benefits of electronic voting are either not clear or are exaggerated. Some people claim that eVoting will give increased participation rates, but I've never seen any evidence that supports this. The UK did trials on a range of eVoting methods and didn't get any increase in participation rates. Some people claim that eVoting will save money. In Ireland, each voting machine required an additional dedicated operator to ensure that the machine gets reset between voters. The cost of these extra staff outweighed the saving on vote counting staff.\r\rWhat problem are we really trying to fix here?", "user": "5e8e614b13fbf12789ba1b87ad5d68aa", "date": "February 25, 2012, 11:54AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "online_mobile_voting_increase_accessibility_for_all", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Shane,\r\r\r\rthanks for raising your concerns about electronic voting machines, particularly from Ireland's experiences, as it show the huge importance of having a voting system that is trusted to be secure & reliable by the general populace.\r\rThe watchouts you bring up here are even more important, considering that the stalled voting system switch we are talking about in Ireland is to basic electronic voting (which is already widely used in other countries: for example, in the United States, the majority of accessible voting systems are actually already direct recording electronic voting machines, and almost 30% of the votes cast in 2004 were by direct recording electronic voting machines). Just to be clear, this concept is proposing online/mobile voting, which would be a form of electronic voting.\r\rTAKEAWAY 1: switching to electronic voting machines (already used elsewhere, including in the US) stalled in Ireland, due to the lack of backup verification/audit mechanisms. This points to the huge importance of having a voting system (physical, electronic, online, or otherwise) that is trusted to be secure & reliable.\r\r\r\rIt seems that a key problem with the electronic voting machines in Ireland, is that they lacked the paper trail for an audit/verification system. Without this audit/verification system, I agree, I wouldn't trust this type of electronic voting either.\r\rIn the online/mobile voting proposal above, the audit/verification system is designed so that each vote generally creates at least 4 duplicate records (a printed paper receipt for the voter, a printed vote paper trail for the election organizer, a digital receipt for the voter, and at least 1 digital record of the vote--that can be easily duplicated multiple times). The concept allows for verification by the election organizer (you can count up paper ballots, just like in a regular paper ballot system), verification that their vote was accurately included by each voter, & verification of accurate tallies by independent election observers, while also preserving voter privacy. In other words, the backup paper trail & amount of verification possible for this online/mobile voting concept is actually more than is possible with a traditional paper ballot system.\r\rTAKEAWAY 2: the proposed online/mobile voting concept actually provides more of a backup paper trail (at least 4 duplicate records, 2 physical), and more verification/audit possibilities (by election organization, voter, & independent observers), than a traditional paper ballot system.\r\r\r\rYou're also right Shane that an electronic system to protect user privacy relies on complex cryptography, which is hard for people to understand. However, I I don't think this obstacle is necessarily insurmountable. After all, we trust these same encryption algorithms in our online banking (both for password verification that ensures only you can access your account, while ensuring even the bank doesn't know your secret password; and for protecting your financial information as it's sent back & forth between you & your financial institution). Another example, most people today don't truly understand how airplanes, automobiles, & trains function, but we all generally trust these inventions to move us around without exploding & killing us.\r\rTAKEAWAY 3: Trust in complex systems is not just based on complete knowledge & understanding. It's also based on other factors like history/experience, legitimacy given by others that you trust, etc. This is certainly a design opportunity to find ways to build trust/legitimacy in online/mobile/electronic voting, such as through education materials, and pilots in local elections & referendums, rather than immediate topdown national directives.\r\r\r\rFinally, I agree with you Shane, that any new innovation, particularly one that isn't implemented properly, can cause problems, and even not achieve it's intended benefits, such as increased voting participation. That's why careful implementation and minimizing the risk through pilots is so important. And, when online voting is properly implemented, there's certainly the chance to increase voter turnout. For example, Markham, one of the 1st major Canadian municipalities to try online voting in 2003, increased turnout by 35% after implementation. Afterwards, 80 more Canadian municipalities have implemented online voting. And ~80% of Canadians in a survey said they want the option to vote online & would do so if it was available. In fact, Canada's chief electoral officer is seeking approval to further test online voting in an upcoming byelection.\r\rTAKEAWAY 4: Online voting, when properly implemented, has already been shown to increase voter turnout, and gain trust, legitimacy, & popular support from the voting populace.\r\r\r\rNOTE: Shane, I really appreciate your comment, which points to very important watchouts & legitimate concerns. Given Ireland's experience ( 55 million is a huge amount to spend, and unfortunately not achieve the desired goals! ), I certainly wouldn't recommend pushing down a top-down directive for some huge voting system change in Ireland right now. At the same time, other countries may be in a different situation where voting systems like electronic, online, mobile, & otherwise may make sense.", "user": "b15ab3f829f0f897fe507ef548741afb", "date": "February 26, 2012, 12:42AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "online_mobile_voting_increase_accessibility_for_all", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Interesting discussion.\rI can see the inevitability of online and/or mobile voting in the USA just as we have largely moved away from (but not eliminated) imprint transactions on credit card (A month ago I did an imprint transaction for the first time in over 10 years).\rThere are two issues in this discussion I should like to revisit.\r\r1 Separation of establishing entitlement to cast a ballot and the act of casting that ballot - together they form the process of voting.\rIn physical polling places this should be straightforward regardless of whether the ballot is cast on paper, through a machine or online terminal to which access is only available once entitlement is established. It is this 'obvious to all' separation that preserves the privacy and anonymity of the cast ballot.\rWith the banking transaction, unlike in the voting system, it is highly desirable that the transaction is correctly identified with the transactor (voter). Thus analogies with the banking system (including the telephone voting system used by Australian visually impaired voters) carry impressions of non-anonymity.Overcoming this perception is a necessary part of the education of potential online/mobile voters.\rIn mature democracies I suspect most people will not care if the \"system\" actually knows what choices an individual has made because beyond the collective result the \"system\" has no interest in following up the choices of individuals. On the other hand in emerging democracies and places where corruption is extensive the \"system\" may have a vested interest in knowing how an individual has voted and introducing online or mobile voting even in places like India probably posses as many problems as it solves.\r\rOne additional word of caution regarding online voting that is banking related is the issue of phishing. - again perhaps more concerning in emerging democracies.\r\r2. The paper audit trail is an interesting issue.\rI can see the slight benefit in providing it to allow physical recounts in close elections although malfunctions in printing are probably as likely, in the overall scheme of things, as are malfunctions in the electronic count on which the production of the paper trail is based in the first place. I presume that, as in this country, recounts occur largely for two reasons the margin of the result is sufficiently narrow to warrant reexamining the votes, or there is dispute in determining the intention of voters through the marking of the ballot paper.\rWhere a paper copy of the vote is produced it is a matter of judgement (or legislative edict) which is the true record and therefore where there are discrepancies between electronic counts and those based on the paper copy, which count is to be accepted as the correct result. Again in Australia in the physical polling places we maintain a count of the ballots made available, the ballots issued, the ballots remaining unissued and the total of votes cast. Usually these balance but occasionally we have to go through rubbish bins to locate ballots thrown away and very rarely the election official in charge will have to file a discreption report. I imagine but don't know if a similar paper record is produced following a telephone or online ballot here probably with similar questions about the necessity for it.\r\rFinally, at least for Australian voting, I remain a fan of the use of paper based ballots for most situations (for one thing it provides gainful if low paid employment for some people). On the other hand I am in favour of using technology where it can assist those who have no access to voting or whose access causes discomfort or unsatisfactory voting experiences.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "February 26, 2012, 02:11PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "online_mobile_voting_increase_accessibility_for_all", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Paul for your continued adds! Lots of great points raised, and I'm enjoying the discussions =).\r\rUnsurprisingly, I agree with you about the inevitability of online voting ;), though I'm certainly not going to pretend I have a crystal ball and can predict time lines. I think the best we can do is try to understand where society is moving, and initiate positive impact projects that take this and specific regional contexts into account.\r\rTo address the 2 issues you raised to revisit:\r\r\r\r\r1) Agreed about the importance of providing separation between \"identification/verification of voting eligibility\" and the \"actual vote choice made\", and really, all the points you made here. In the traditional physical voting process in private booths (assuming no one tries to \"hack\" the system, such as directly through physical coercion or indirectly, say through hidden cameras), this separation is relatively complete & intuitively obvious. A digital voting system can have the same level of complete separation (as you mentioned can be, and actually is often currently, done with electronic voting in physical locations. For an online/mobile system, if desired, the same level of complete separation can be enforced (literally no stored linkage between your identification & your vote), though you're right that there's a design/education challenge to overcome given perceptions of non-anonymity. In terms of phishing this is currently a concern\r\r\r-Note: One thing I'd like to add here, is that there's a partial tradeoff between A) separation of voting eligibility/actual vote choice to ensure anonymity, and B) keeping enough records to maximize verifiability/auditability (that totals are accurate, all votes have been counted, all votes are legitimate, etc.).\r\rTo take the extreme case, the most anonymous vote would only keep track of vote totals...period (any other records would be continuously destroyed): even with anonymous paper ballots, there are many ways to try to triangulate someone's vote, from factors like knowing which polling place they went to, to narrowing down stack position in the ballot box to when they voted, to obtaining biometric information like fingerprints/DNA from the physical ballot =P. This would basically provide no verifiability/auditability though, you need to trust there were no weaknesses/corruptions in the system.\r\rOn the other extreme end, the most verifiable/auditable vote would be publicly recording your vote & associated identity in full view of others (like how many of our democratic legislative bodies function). Full accountability, no anonymity. \r\rHow this tradeoff is balanced is really a decision that each voting populace needs to make for itself. An interesting thing with advanced encryption is that it provides a way to decrease this tradeoff, and thus increase both desired goals. Through advanced one-way encryption, it's possible to reach a relatively high level of anonymity & verifiability/auditability at the same time.\r\r\r2) In regards to paper trails, physical and digital, agreed that just like the systems that they backup, nothing is perfect, and there's always the possibilities of malfunctions. Yet, these redundant backups together, can create more resilience in the voting system results & legitimacy: e.g.  it makes it harder for anyone to completely corrupt/rig the vote, increases confidence in the voting system & final vote tallies particularly in close elections (or in the cases of conflicting recounts, provides evidence for when a revote may be ruled necessary). Of course there are tradeoffs here too, so the exact amount of redundancy is another decision to be made, and likely to change with time, given how experienced/confident people are with a particular voting system.", "user": "b15ab3f829f0f897fe507ef548741afb", "date": "February 26, 2012, 07:11PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "online_mobile_voting_increase_accessibility_for_all", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Hmm...some of my comment seems to be cut off.

After all, this is the 1st & main vote that's generally totaled to determine the results of an election.\r\rWhen someone votes, they receive an easy to read/understand receipt (digital & printed) clearly detailing how they voted, along with a special code that they can use to lookup & verify that their vote is included correctly in the primary record (which can actually be publicly posted, for both individual voters, and for independent election observers/media to verify individual votes & totals).\r\rIf desired, there's even the possibility of having a live video feed of the election organizer's printed vote paper trail, to ensure that it matches up with your own receipts printed at home. Or, in the case of having a separate identity verification at a physical location (one of the options proposed by Rachel Happen, & incorporated in the concept above under the sub-section \"*POTENTIAL FOR SEPARATING ACTS OF VOTING & ELIGIBLE VOTER IDENTITY VERIFICATION\"), you can have all paper receipts printed out during physical verification for you to check. Both the virtual & physical options can allow you to 100% match all 4 duplicate records against each other to make sure they match.

Perhaps a better way (to allow people to correct a voting error, or if they change their mind, say due to breaking news of a corruption scandal),  is to allow for each person/phone # to change their vote up to a certain time, and only have the last vote preference recorded.\r\rAs for implementing so that people are likely voting independently from their phones and not being coerced to do otherwise, below's one potential way to tackle this. People pre-register to vote with their phone #'s and are given an associated secret voting pin #/password & confirmation secret phrase (similar to how dial-in televoting is already working in some countries). This ensures that each phone # that votes is only associated with one registered voter (so someone couldn't just buy/obtain a bunch of mobiles/SIM cards to vote multiple times). This double confirmation of identity through an associated phone # AND pin (stored through one-way encryption on the database side), also helps guard against hacking/phreaking attempts.\r\rPeople vote by texting their pin #, then vote choice, which is then confirmed with a reply text that contains their secret phrase. If a friend tries to vote for someone, the friend would not know the pin #. If the militia tries to coerce someone to vote/change their vote a certain way, that person can simply fake a vote by entering a fake pin #. A confirmation reply text would still be sent, proving to the militia that the person had voted, but it would contain the wrong secret phrase, discreetly confirming to the coerced individual that his/her vote is still intact.\r\rOne could also imagine this \"texting\" vote system implemented by \"automated voice\" to increase accessibility, though this would likely have larger end-voter cost implications in developing countries, unless subsidized by the government/carriers.\r\r-Thanks for the comment and though provoking questions Myles =).

I've thought for a long time that there is not just one solution to making elections more accessible (in all senses of the word), but that we need to improve in many little areas to add up to a larger impact.\r\rYou ask some great questions. I'll try to answer a few:\r\rPolitical scientists do study participation, and what effects it. Some of this work relies on studying the results of elections; other is research on pilot projects. \r\rDesigners might be interested in Better Ballots, a report by the Brennan Center (disclosure: I am a co-author). It started from the work of political scientist, David Kimball, and looked at how ballot design might have affected elections. \rhttp://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/better_ballots/\r\rAbsentee voting laws vary by state. Many states allow a voter to select this method for preference; others require one of a list of reasons. Often people with disabilities can sign up to be permanent absentee voters, and have their ballots and other materials delivered automatically, but this assumes that they can use a paper ballot independently. \r\rIn the past several years, there has been a lot of attention to overseas  and military voters (called UOCAVA voters, for the Uniformed and Overseas Civilian Absentee Voting Act, passed in 1986). States often have systems that allow them to deliver ballots via the web or email, cutting down the time to receive ballots.\r\rAlthough there have been some exceptions and experiments, casting a vote over the web is still rare - and is prohibited in many states. There are security and privacy issues that make everyone cautious.\r\rElection laws are mostly state laws, because in the US federal system, states run elections. They can be hard to change: As someone once said to me, everyone who has to vote on the change was elected under the current system. But, we have also seen changes made for better design, championed by election directors. One example: in Chicago, the election director got a change made in the state law to remove a requirement that names and other information be printed in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. Election departments around the country are trying a lot of different things, and everyone is learning from each other. \r\rIn Oregon, by the way, the iPad-based voting system is used by people who cannot use the paper ballot mailed to all registered voters. They can come to a voting center, or request that election officials bring the system to them.

I also worked in litigation technology for awhile - so I know how hard it is to change the law - especially when it comes to technology. So I guess we can only make incremental changes - for the time being.\r\rBut at the same time - all of our financial information - social security numbers - bank accounts - health records are floating around on the web and for the most part - they all remain secure. I really believe the benefits out weigh the costs when it comes to this issue. It will be interesting to see when these laws start to change and which states implement changes first.

The information on the existing ballot is confusing because it's very hard for voters(with cognitive limitations) to figure out the relations between all the information(e.g. the 'candidates' information lays under the 'contest' information, and the 'help' information should always available though the voting process). The new ballot design will re-arrange the information on the ballot according to the priority. And the relations between the information will be emphasized by using some visual, audio, and tactile elements.\r\rAnd also I'm thinking of the way that the general voting systems access these information. It's not about a specific voting system design. The voting systems have something in common about their ways to access the information. Generally, the voting systems access the information of ballot in a linear way. So the inappropriate arrangement of information will make the systems to take more steps to access a certain piece of information(e.g. the 'review ballot' information is always in the end of the ballot.

You have to be at least 18 years old, be an American (or naturalized) citizen, and be a registered voter.  Each state has more requirements.  Here's a website to give more info to cast a vote in USA.\rhttp://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781452.html\rFurthermore, each state has passed laws to add more constraints to the USA voting system.  For example, in the 2000 Presidential election between George Bush (republican) and Al Gore (Democrat), the governor of Florida (Jeb Bush, a republican) passed voting restrictions and enforced them on areas that are majority Democrat registered voters.  Although Gore won the popular (people) vote, Bush won the electoral vote.   Historically,  American voters have always been vulnerable to rhetoric and deception by political candidates.  IMO deception is an integral part of the election campaign of every candidate.  A portion of the American population believe mud slinging (disparaging remarks) is a sign of strength in a candidate.  If candidate_A says \"I can lower taxes & balance the (budget) books without cutbacks on any programs (spending)\" and candidate_B says \"there is no way we can balance the books without either cutting back on spending or increasing taxes...\"   the American voters will select candidate_A.   This is why the USA has a serious deficit & cannot solve its domestic problems; the vast majority of registered American voters are not realistic in analyzing the situation.  They want instant gratification, so they select candidate_A without analyzing his statement.   Candidate_B is too realistic of the situation, which is why this candidate will loose the election.  Candidate_A is making promises he's not likely going to keep, but his statement appeals to various voters.  The middle and upper middle-class voters will focus on his promise to lower taxes, while the working class (blue collar) will focus on his promise not to cut spending on social programs to help people on the lower end of the socio-economic ladder.  To summarize, the failure of American government lies in the voters.   In the end, they often vote the wrong candidate into office because the American voters wants instant gratification.

If polling staff are hurt by a mentally unstable voter who becomes violent when voters with opposing views verbally express their feelings, then it raises the question of the added cost of security to protect the safety of polling staff.  IMO the cheapest way to make it easier to cast their vote is online voting.  We can pay our bills and make  retail purchases online, so why not expand internet use to online voting as well ??

The restaurants lobbied (and passed) a law making it a criminal violation for lunch trucks (with cooking grills) to do business in these counties.  The only lunch trucks allowed are ones who sell cold sandwiches or pre-made hot sandwiches.  This law was intended to increase restaurants' lunch-time revenue.

Hypothetically, anyone can access anyone else's online bank account and vote for them. For instance, my father has access to my online account and he could easily go in and vote for me and my actual vote be excluded. There is no way to know if the person behind the screen is actually the actual account owner. In the public voting booth method, there is someone there to verify that you are who you say you are by confirming it with your ID. Here that certification is lost. In addition, banks are privately owned corporations. The banks wouldn't be fond of the government coming in to their online accounts and monitoring the system like you describe. There would need to be an extensive amount of programming and security measures used to successfully separate the government from the online banking accounts. I would think the individual would also feel a bit wary about allowing the government such control, even if the government officials were not interested in the bank accounts of the online voting populace. There is a high level of suspicion when speaking about anyone associated with the government and to seemingly allow them access to some of your most private and personal information would make some people cringe. There is also the question of whether or not the fact that the banking industry is a private industry would in any way inhibit the execution of this idea. What I mean to say is that the government and the private industries have always been relatively separate in their operations (with some clear exceptions). If you propose mixing them in something so personal as voting, the implications could be disastrous. At best, it would receive insane amounts of criticism and garner heavy skepticism, adding fuel to the political fire and starting up heated debate about whether or not your vote was counted.

If any of these ideas are already implemented but failed, then quick analysis on the reasons of failure can be done if they are repairable given the multi-dimensional constraints then they are the immediate wins ... e-voting in India is a good case study, when they first announced e-voting i just didn't believe this will work but it worked.", "user": "337e865f92fc3b02bd963a8cbd68a6a3", "date": "March 01, 2012, 01:31AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "_future_elections_", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Great to hear you've been using our Brainstorm-in-a-Box toolkit from Singapore!

Although they aren't normally used for dealing with sensitive information like banks and health centers, theater settings would provide existing infrastructure for visual dissemination of voting information, accessibility, and high volume traffic (for both cars and people).  \r\rOne of the key challenges in creating a successful election experience is ensuring that the public is making well-informed decisions.  Movie theaters would be able to provide high-level, visual information about major issues like policies, candidates and their platforms, and the voting process itself.  Instead of movies, these different categories of information could be shown in different theater rooms within the same building. Voters would be able to freely choose the type of information to get a better understanding of, with showtimes listed for easy scheduling.  These showings could help improve large-scale public knowledge and also cater to citizens whose first language is not English with subtitles or translated videos.\r\rMovie theaters also already incorporate other aspects of accessibility that can be taken advantage of.  For example, wheelchair accessibility is common.  Handicapped individuals would be able to park close to the location and enter any of the informational viewings previously discussed.  Those with hearing disabilities could utilize videos with English subtitles, while those with visual disabilities could be escorted to and from viewings, listening to the information presented.  Theaters also have public restrooms and food amenities that can be provided to allow voters to stay in the same location and spend as much time as necessary to understand the election information.  Once comfortable with details of the elections, voters could return to a lobby converted into a polling place, allowing a continuous flow of learning and voting.\r\rThe ability to accommodate a large volume of people within a movie theater would improve convenience and also strengthen citizens as a community.  Many voters would be able to create their own schedules to learn political issues that they did not have the time or resources to evaluate on their own.  Since many major theater buildings also have ample space, benefits of this project could reach many more voters without disturbing the important functions of institutions like banks or hospitals.  It also is possible a theater could become a hub for discussion and create a sense of community.  Groups of voters could attend informational showings together and motivate their families/friends to join them.

Despite 30 of these resolutions, PR is still the oldest and most populated colony in the world!  It is obvious by now that the US is not going to decolonize PR just because the UN asks. \r\rThrough education, we must create a domestic and international solidarity with this cause to pressure the US to do what historically she has refused to do.  This is why we need everyone who also believes that colonialism is a crime against humanity to join the protest to demand compliance to international law!\r\rPuerto Rico has been a colony of the US for 114 years.

Now I see that it is proved that there are completely different perceptions in people, and I think that this can help us to put ourselves in other people's skin.
