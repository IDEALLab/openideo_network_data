Would love to contribute to ideas about incentivizing members of networks to contribute. We build networks of civil society organizations who work in remote locations, on development, health, religious, etc issues, to collect data for our UNLocK network. Incentivizing without affecting the data is a major issue we have been grappling with for years. For CSOs, we've found they can tire of sending data without getting access to the aggregated data and the analysis. Giving them a product based on their own data was our first lesson learned.  After a time though, they tire of sending warning data and not having a response mechanism at a local level. So we are working now on a small grants program without, as you rightly point out, having individuals be tempted to report incorrectly. We use a hub NGO in each country as an access point and to verify information. For our grants program, we are developing an advisory model so that the group basically determines the grants with some technical assistance.\rWhat I really like about your idea is the use of traders and their network and the business aspects of this.

For example, a rumor about an approaching militia is often enough to trigger a mass displacement.  For our group, we are working to find true markers of violence or instability that don't yield false positives or rumors.  In our project, which is currently operating, we track post-rape medications.  \r\rI'm curious to have your feedback: http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/stop-mass-sexual-violence/\r\rI wonder about the interruption of trade as a marker for instability.  For example, if 20 bicycles normally run a route from Point A to Point B and they all stop suddenly, could that then trigger more investigation?  In areas where I've worked, trade does not continue during times of extreme violence.  I also think your model can work without financial incentives.

I know people can often be motivated by a sense of responsibility and love for community, but I also think incentives can help motivate people who would otherwise be too afraid of reprisal. Incentives based on confirming reports from other members of the network could also prevent misinformation. \r\rThe other impetus behind providing bicycles and business knowledge is to enrich the community and provide people with a way to improve their economic position. I like the idea of something that both informs people and prevents violence while simultaneously helping the local economy. The potential to help entire communities, not just the couriers themselves, is pretty huge. For this reason, I think the idea of incentives is worth the risk, but I do see your point.\r\rI like your concept for identifying patterns through medical treatment, and I am thrilled that you have found success in the DRoC, but I am also interested in a more active reporting structure, instead of a passive one.

The beauty about this idea is that it requires no involvement or planning in the event of civilian conflict, as people will do what they always do in these situations. It is not the victim that needs to start a fire in order to send an alert.\r\rThe aggressors will inadvertently trigger the alarm themselves by doing what they always do...slash and burn. It is this caveman mentality that allows them to butcher innocent civilians.\r\rIf you look in news footage, every conflict situation is accompanied by multiple fires of some sort, whether it is burning tires, burning vehicles or burning buildings - all started by the very same people doing the butchering. All we have to do is monitor the number of smoke plumes in a geographic area...and voila, we got them.\r\rThe smoke coming from biomass fires, such as forests is usually white-grey in color whereas smoke from artificial materials normally found in buildings, vehicles and things like tires usually produce a dark-grey to black smoke plume. This is another way of detecting and differentiating between normal bush fires and possible conflict situations.\r\rThis system is by no means the only method. This will simply act as an early warning system, which will then require further surveillance and investigation by other satellites, drones or even feet on the ground.\r\rThe idea is not to inform local populations to start fires as this information can lead to their death, should it come out that they are trying to warn the outside world.", "user": "aa7ba696fba7f5875fffd6d2eb8326b6", "date": "April 21, 2013, 10:58PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["applying_technology", "signaling_danger", "hubs_connectors_and_networks", "enabling_action"], "comment_count": 4, "title": "Smoke Signals: Detecting smoke via satellite.", "evaluations": null, "type": "concept", "id": "smoke_signals", "applause": 1}, "identifield": {"description": "Children in conflict zones need exist Identification cards by territories with QR codes system, managed by NGOs will help to identify the red zones for children and to children for know the info for protection in crisis situation only need a movil&#13;\n", "views": 535, "creator": "7d5d999b4ef43ed3f0a388ab2559b0b1", "url": "http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/identifield", "image": "http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/identifield/gallery/identifield-1.png/", "created": {"py/object": "datetime.datetime", "__reduce__": [{"py/type": "datetime.datetime"}, ["B90ECAMDAAAAAA=="]]}, "comments": [{"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "identifield", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Interesting thoughts.

One case included providing a source (radio station) with the internet, voice data recorders, and listeners (key influencers) with cell phones. The DJ would text or call those individuals prior to going on air. There was another case in a London terror situation where flash mobile phone usage shut down or overloaded cell towers. Police agencies switched to RF Pager systems to communicate. RF pagers devices won the day because of they can function on little signals. They are also the preferred method of communication within hospitals, large warehouses and other environments where getting a signal is hard. I guess the question is can the Radio, Pagers an ICT platforms be combined to create an early warning system. I'll do more exploring here.

I think that when commonalities are acknowledged, it becomes more difficult to justify discrepancies. Before the U.S. Civil War, for example, if the white supremacists acknowledged slaves as human beings, they would have had a harder time justifying their atrocities. I think this basic acknowledgement of others as human beings deserving of equal rights is at the base of many of our society's problems. \r\rIn regards to your inspiration, Vladislav, maybe the declaration of human rights could serve as a jumping off point. It's strange to me to think that we should establish someone else's base aesthetics (bigger house, fancy paint, etc.) but we CAN promote ideas that can be backed by facts. Nice schools (i.e. enough space, plenty of supplies, current books) will help to better educate children who can then get better jobs and be equipped to help others in the future. Better homes (proper sanitation, floors, sturdy roof) can help keep people healthy and safe. Clean common areas help prevent the spread of disease. So perhaps promoting the end result first and following up with promoting how they can get there would be better?\r\rThe subject of genocide is tougher and I can empathize with the people who are too afraid to talk since I read so many cases of such people while with Amnesty International. In the cases where people feel like genocide is the norm, perhaps helping them become aware that it is NOT the norm elsewhere will make them yearn for a peaceful life and will prove to be the impetus of change. It's widely accepted that foreign travel helps to broaden the mind and see that there is a world full of different societies and values, but since people living with genocide cannot travel, perhaps the world could be brought to them. They should see that peaceful pastures exist; that elsewhere people walk to school in safety; that people of different races coexist in many cities.

And that is even more exciting for us - because we do see our concept as a tool to be used by others (and us, when we have the resources, but we won't always be there).  The idea of putting our concept out on this platform was we believe that organizations trying to \"own\" a concept like this has meant they havent been successful in the past.

Every source of data and every type of response has its limitations, strengths, weaknesses, and varying perspectives. But if we can bring these together, I think we can do as you say - and actually get to practical responses based on understanding the issues and environment better and involving all stakeholders. We have to be smarter about knowing who is doing what and who knows what. We are dealing with a multidisciplinary issue when we look at atrocity or conflict prevention, and it needs a multidisciplinary approach for the solution. And it isnt just about the \"international community\"'s response and knowledge but about the wider stakeholder base in any affected area - whether we are international, national, local or represent a company, government, NGO, funder, or community, we all are stakeholders that need to better understand the environment and what others are doing so response can be smarter and more efficient and hopefully more effective!

Long-term, our hope is information sharing and collaboration on responses through a network like this could mean there were fewer \"helpless villages.\"\r\r2 - Depending on what data and which responders we could get involved in the network, however, maybe this could in some cases stop the rebels.

One problem I can envisage for example, is that perpetrators attack people found with copies of these cards on them or at home. It's not uncommon that perpetrators attack twice the same place and react brutally against those they perceive as having reported about their previous behavior for example. How to circulate, and more importantly how to securely store these cards once filled before these are again collected and centralized for processing is key.\r\rOn another issue. How do you envisage to verify the credibility of the information reported and prevent or mitigate false reports? And since it's intended to be anonymous, how do you intend to assess the reliability of your sources? Also, anonymous information is of limited use in future judicial proceeding for example. And how wold your sources know what is being done with the information they provided. One should be careful not to raise expectations one cannot answer.\r\rHope I don't scare you off with all my comments ;-) \r\rMaybe a possible solution to these issues is to only use those cards to sensitize populations about best reporting procedures and available channels so that, when incidents happen, they can report them in a relevant manner through channels which don't leave (or leave less) traces.

Moreover, to the concept regarding collaboration is nothing more than stealing ideas together is not with keeping of the terms of the platform. Specifically, under the FAQ section it clearly states that the concepts are owned by the person(s) originally creating the concepts and they grant a non-exclusive right to the Challenge Host to reuse, mash up, and publish, etc. This does not grant the rights to other collaborators to take pieces of other people's concepts without permission and integrate them into their own concept as their own piece of work. By definition, this ownership of the idea would require the original author to be involved in the collaboration. \r\rFurther, in a collaborative environment simply believing that you can exclude the original authors of ideas to better your own discourages and excludes others and these authors from future collaborations, which violates the OPEN IDEO Terms of Use. \r\rWhen you \"steal ideas together\" from other people's concepts that have made the prototyping phase you take away from the community's attention to the original concept, which can reduce the community's collaboration to help build out the original concept, which again reduces the overall collaboration and potentially negates the potential benefits that could have been received from further development of the original concept. Overall, the purpose of this platform is two fold, to design innovative solutions to problems in the same manner IDEO does with their commercial clients, and to create this solution to help the challenge host achieve social good, and simply believing collaboration means to steal ideas to make your own better reduces the achievement of the purpose. \r\rThink of it from terms of a university group project. If your group created a solution to the assignment problem based on your idea but then excluded you from the rest of the process and submitted the idea telling the professor and the rest of the world you were not involved, is it right? They were collaborating, so they were simply stealing ideas together to make it better. Would you ever want to work with that group again? \r\rLastly, this exhibits one of the drawbacks to this platform and highlights shortcomings about its implementation. Each concept in the proto phase essentially ends up being a single group project with its own collaborative team, and if someone decides to steal across projects because it is not explained or moderated, it takes away from that other group in terms of both future collaboration and seeing what could become of the original idea. I believe this is a unique situation that IDEO does not run into when prototyping their own ideas, because, as I recall, when designing a problem solution, they work together as a single team to narrow it down to a few ideas to prototype and break off into groups to finish it. They do not take away group members that are working on one prototype to work on their own by taking the core idea of that group and integrating it into their own and thus resulting in one of the ideas never getting help from the community to finish getting designed. Sure, if they get stuck on a small problem, they go ask the other groups how they resolved it, but they do not completely steal the ideas from each other. The video \"The Deep Dive,\" found on YouTube shows IDEO at work on a shopping cart. You will notice them working together. Remember collaborate means to work jointly, not steal ideas and exclude.

When you say that \"there is at least one concept that you have copied a piece of almost word for word without citing or referencing or involving the original concept's author\" - I'm interested in knowing which one? I got really nervous and confused and have just had a read through the concept text. As far is I know, I've linked to the concepts (Enabler messages, crisis tracker, how to get relevant information and verify it with low cost technology, and raise a red flag). Much of the information is directly derived or based on the comments below, in particular Richard Brion who is also cited. The one this I've copied word for word is the reference to the inspiration 'Speak-to-tweet', which I am also the author of. But if there is one I have missed, I'm terribly sorry and will update it with the correct citations, so please let me know.  I admit I haven't read the FAQs, but I've always thought that the common goal here was collaboration - it's not a game, there's not a winner - we're just solving problems!

Granted, it appears he changed the name from the concept to the prototype phase, but his idea is still in the prototyping phase. \r\rIt seems the point I was making was not clear. Yes, the FAQs say that the community is solving problems and that there are no winners, but that doesn't create the option to take the idea plug it in to yours and call it collaboration. Collaboration is working jointly. \r\rLooking at Richard's concept, it appears he put significant work into it, and has received little interaction or feedback from the community. It appears he was posting to himself for the most part when he created new pieces to his concept. For someone to take anyone's ideas and work that they put that much time and effort into it and incorporate it as their own without interacting with them or including them in the process is inconsiderate. \r\rIt also reduces overall collaboration that may have resulted in an even stronger concept than either of the two of your ideas alone. For example, in his latest iterations, Richard's idea is about creating a modular system built of low cost communication technologies that provides flexibility of deployment based on a specific area's needs. In thinking about it from this platform position, it seems that the people's radio could be a very useful module of Richard's idea that could be used in countries where it would work well when coupled with the other elements of his platform. However, by taking core pieces of his idea and simply plugging them into yours, this has not been discussed. As a matter of fact, I see few comments in his concept that are anything other than him either stating his updates or asking for feedback from the community. This is what I mean by excluding and discouraging collaboration. \r\rYou are right, it is not a competition, it is a way to design ideas and solutions together, which means working with these people. If you go look at some of the other concepts, there are great examples of the authors of separate concepts that saw the benefits of their own concepts to the other person's and started working together and building upon that synergy together. \r\rFinal food for thought, OPEN IDEO didn't include the statement about ownership of ideas arbitrarily.

Do you think a Q&A session would be helpful for this challenge as well?", "user": "6fed0e6f1ba44f0520bc14fceee3663d", "date": "April 02, 2013, 11:54AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "people_s_radio", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "By the way, I was also wondering in how far technologies like the Pirate communications (as shared by Richard in his Idea: http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/pirate-communications/ ) or the mobile mesh networks (see this inspiration by karl: http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/pirate-communications/ ) could be helpful.

For example, to many's surprise, mobile phones are highly prevalent throughout Africa. This unfortunately does not mean that infrastructure exists in all of the rural areas to allow for mobile phone communications 100% of the time. \r\rAdditionally, there are usually some form of RF stations, and Motorola or other HF or UHF communications as well as internet access. Landlines exist in limited supply because of infrastructure needs and demands, and can be disabled as simply as cutting one major trunk line. Disabling these technologies will take different forms as well depending on who the aggressor is. Simple signal jammers are very effective and can be made with parts found at a Radio Shack. Cutting off the power supply to grids containing mobile towers and radio towers is another effective and simple tactic. More destructive forms can include destroying the transmission towers. \r\rHF and UHF radio transmitters require base stations with antennas coupled with antenna like repeaters in order to facilitate over the horizon communication (OTH). Without these, the man portable transmitters are useless just like a cell phone trying to make a call in an area without cell phone towers.\r\rYou specifically mentioned the use of HF transmitters in Uganda. The LRA is not the in power party, so their ability to completely disable the HF infrastructure is more limited. However, in places like Mali, or the DRC where coups occur and the hostile party takes control of the entire system, access to the communications backbone becomes almost as simple as a light switch. Take China's ability to completely turn on/off the internet should they wish. They are also completely capable of disabling international dial out access from cell phones. Anything that is transmitted through an existing infrastructure is an easy target. \r\rSpecific to this idea, establishing the necessary antennas and repeaters to utilize RF/HF/UHF radio would require noticeable activity and the support towers are not easily concealed. Think about any broadcast antenna you have seen; how would you conceal it from miles away? Every radio, including the HF ones used in Uganda, must have a radio tower to transmit and receive. \r\rAs far as traceability goes, first the towers are visible; so, once you see the tower, destroying it or otherwise disabling will take down the network rendering it useless. If, for some reason they could only find the repeaters, disabling these repeaters reduces the distance the transmission can travel. Further, unless someone is using a mobile transmitter, like a Codan vehicle mounted UHF radio, or a Motorola handset, or something manufactured by Harris, stationary transmissions are easily triangulated to find the source, which can place lives at risk. Even if they use the mobile transmitters, all that is needed is to take out or disable the towers. \r\rLastly, people would be surprised at how prevalent and inexpensive mobile handsets are in numerous countries throughout Africa. Nokia, specifically, has done a tremendous job creating handsets that have mobile internet and wifi capabilities at a cost of about $25. In addition, Kenya, for example, has developed the most sophisticated bank  in the world using your mobile device system. People, even in the most rural of areas, are capable of paying vendors with a simple SMS message. Nonetheless, in many places throughout rural Africa, the phones may have intermittent coverage at times, but many people still own them. \r\rUsing pirate communication technologies, like wireless access drones, HPCP, or Pirate Boxes to give off grid access to the internet and voice communications, allows for the existing mobile phones to still communicate even if the cellular, radio, or other communication towers are destroyed or otherwise disabled. \r\rThe question becomes twofold for this concept: first, how can get messages to the single transmission source without relying on the infrastructures controlled by aggressive regimes, and; second, how do we ensure sustainable coverage of a radio network's infrastructure when it will likely become a quick target?", "user": "76b39d1ed6df674fbf99046a5a9d895a", "date": "April 02, 2013, 02:36PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "people_s_radio", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Richard, thanks so much for this information!

As you mention yourself, people can basically say anything, so pollution (propaganda, irrelevant info, fake info, etc.) is a risk.\r- How do we make sense of all this uploaded voices? Can we easily convert voices to text and subsequently try to extract relevant concepts and issues automatically? Lot's of data is good, but if it cannot be presented in a digestible format for analysis, it will be hard to assess its relevance and verify it against other pieces of information.\r\rAs an analyst from profession, I need, among other things, to be able to verify the reliability of a source and the credibility of information, hence the need to get this information structured in some ways, which is what I proposed to do here using SMS(http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/how-to-get-relevant-information-and-verify-it-with-low-cost-technology/ and have a look at the process proposed process here http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/how-to-get-relevant-information-and-verify-it-with-low-cost-technology/gallery/relevant-and-verified-infomation-v1-billen-290313-1.pdf/)\r\rBut maybe there is a way to do this over the phone and combining it with speak to tweet as well by having people answering a series of questions.

When I started reading it, I recalled the times when there is some natural disaster in my country (Peru). After a strong earthquake or similar event, making phone calls using a mobile is almost impossible because the communication system gets too crowded. Calling from a land line is also tricky, but you have slightly more chances of completing a call. So, what people do, is that they call to the major radio stations and go live reporting to their relatives that they are fine, requesting for help (medicine, shelter, etc.), or providing contact info to get any information about people they can't find. I think that, maybe instead of recording the messages, these could go live. People may be informed through other media that in a case of emergency they can call to a toll-free number were they will have up to 3 mins to deliver their message. In this way you wouldn't need a recording device/service and calls would be aired in a first come first served basis.

I think there are several pieces that need to come together to have an impact on preventing sexual violence in DRC: reporting and bearing witness, treating and protecting victims, raising awareness, accountability, early warning. The phone technology is significant in that it is free of cost to the caller, can use local languages, offers anonymity. A short code is dialed and there is an automatic call back with voice prompt. The caller then responds to questions and can leave a message, which then goes onto a database.  We are looking at this in terms of reporting violence and giving voice, but I can see that it may have application for early warning, or treatment as in your case. An advantage over simply calling into the radio is of course that there can be several calls at once and we don't rely on language comprehension. \rYou are right that we need to think in terms of the challenges faced by displaced populations, access to the electronics.

Then gaining access to information about where PEP kits are located becomes the motivation for reporting. By using Radio Okapi airwaves to explain PEP kits and advertise the program, listeners would know that treatment exists and to seek it out by using the code.  In other words, wouldn't victims of gender-based violence be more likely to report if they knew that they stood to receive a direct health benefit from reporting?

The first is taking away the feeling of impunity by, for example, reporting on war criminals being prosecuted at such times, or finding other ways to make clear that perpetrators of sexual violence will be found and punished.\rAlso, maybe as a warning system. The soldiers had apparently a heightened sense of aggression, because they had lost a battle. Command structures were lost, and they became an armed group on the loose.

A few thoughts & comments.\r\r1. I believe your friend with experience in Africa is correct. Mobile phone adoption is exceptionally high worldwide.  One additional thought: many feature phones (non-smartphones) support a standard called USSD (unstructured supplementary service data). It's a very low bandwidth, low cost data service see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussd.\r\r2. I also agree that the deadman switch approach is the way to go.  I'm sure there is a variety of useful data that could be sent e.g. a weather forecast. There may be some interesting ways to gamify the experience and incentivize subscribers to be responsive.  All that being said, it should be possible with some simple data analysis to identify poor responders and eliminate them from the overall picture. Also, I think the risk of false positives could similarly be handled with careful data processing. Obviously it depends on the size of the group under threat, but assuming the group has at least a few hundred members, it starts to be pretty hard to fake trigger the alert. You could have various levels of alert from \"no action\" to \"watch\" to \"actively monitor\" to \"alert\". The daily message could be customized for each group to validate the level of alert e.g. \"watch\" groups get a message asking if they have any concerns, \"actively monitor\" get specific questions about whether friends are missing etc.\r\r3. More homes have cellular coverage now than have access to electricity (trying to find the report I read that in), so the areas without coverage are relatively small.  Furthermore, SMS requires very little signal to go through  you can often send SMS when you cannot make a call.  However, for areas that are known or suspected trouble spots, you could address coverage using a temporary bridge, such as this open source mesh network http://www.servalproject.org/.\r\rGood luck with the challenge!\r\r-Nick", "user": "f534ba25fdbd7c656ce56500101a9278", "date": "May 13, 2013, 11:25PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_beacon_let_us_know_you_re_safe", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I have a question.

I know that SMS is widely adopted in many places, but is there a cost associated with sending or receiving these messages? If so, I could see that being a barrier.

So I think the basic SMS back and forth infrastructure needs to be cost free to the user.\r\rAnother thought: when I was growing up a lot of people had summer cottages (we called them camps) out in the woods on various lakes and/or were avid trek-into-the-woods campers. They'd go out every weekend. But this was well before cell phones and many of these places didn't have phone service. So to get messages out to them, you'd use a local radio station which had a daily broadcast called \"Camper's Calls\". A person with a phone (usually in the city) would call into the station and leave a message. Then at the same time (10am?) every day, there'd be 10 minutes of these messages read out. The people at camp would listen, just to hear if there was a message for them. Messages would range from informative \"Mike at Silver Lake, Jake and the boys are coming up this afternoon. They'll bring more beer, hope you caught some fish!\" to emergency \"Susan and Steve near Sibley, your mom's had an accident. Please come back immediately.\" to coded \"Viv, Ted says the cat fixed the lamp.\"\r\rSo getting to my point here: what if the users could text in a message that would then be broadcast widely on a radio at a certain time?

Nokia, specifically, has done a tremendous job creating handsets that have mobile internet and wifi capabilities at a cost of about $25.

Yet, you need to think of the cost associated (per Mary-Lynn's comment) as indeed it might be a barrier to use in some communities. \r\rI just wanted to clarify one point. The messages are shared among the community, which is not only the family and friends of Lee. You also mentioned journalists, NGOs, etc. How are you thinking of sharing the information with them?", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "April 05, 2013, 03:23AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_beacon_let_us_know_you_re_safe", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Anne-Laure, good question in regards to the journalists, NGOs, etc. Clearly we would want to maintain the privacy of individual members and participants.  So I would say that information would be shared publicly if a) it is intended as such (i.e. messages not to anyone specifically (similar to Twitter)) or b) aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, like \"hey in this village everyone just stopped checking in.\"\r\rNow in terms of how this info would get to the journalist, NGOs, etc technically, I've been giving this some thought, and will probably post a separate concept about this.  A lot of ideas we find all involve a central clearinghouse of information, e.g. \"device X will communicate with a central database\".  So this central database/repository/information clearhouse should have a particular shape and design; in a nutshell, it should be a content management system where content is divorced from presentation but accessible via API, and be extensible to receive signals from many different types of devices.  I actually think such an infrastructure could be the basis for unleashing creative forces to deal with the posed challenge in nuanced and unique ways.

The data could be compiled to analyze emerging trends and provide near real-time monitoring, but the onus would be on state actors and NGOs to act on the information.\r\rAdditionally, the APRS system would provide real-time communication in areas where telecommunications infrastructure is limited or non-existent, thus enabling rapid communication within at-risk groups.\r\rWe envisioned COSPAS-SARSAT as a platform to collect data over time, while the APRS system would provide real-time alerts within at-risk groups. The former system would collect data on a large scale, while the latter would inform at-risk groups of immediate danger. \r\rThanks again!\r\rChris", "user": "7254d573e3ec1494a87247fb5800fa0f", "date": "April 21, 2013, 10:18PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "re_purpose_the_cospas_sarsat_and_aprs_communications_networks", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "I do not know about the technology, but I like the idea of using something that already exists.

My first reaction to this challenge was \"panic button\" so I certainly see its value. In the spirit of nurturing this idea I will point out what I see as a few potential problems, not b/c I dislike the idea, but b/c I like it very much and want to see it succeed! \r\r1. Panic buttons only occasionally work in terms of getting people to the scene to prevent mass violence. In 1994 Rwanda hit the panic button. No one came. There was no shortage of information about the atrocity before or during those horrible events. So gathering the information (as stated in the title of the challenge) is only the first step. \r\r2. Posessing a device such as the one you describe could make the person who posesses it a target. It would only be a matter of time until criminal organizations realized these things were present in a community. They would surely seek out those who posessed them and either take the device and/or target that person specifically. You address this in the \"keeping the user safe\" section of your proposal, but data encryption is only the first step. A potential solution would be to add the technology to something ubiquitous.... a cell phone perhaps. And I'm not sure how ubiquitous cell phones are in the more rural areas. Otherwise you've got somebody with a fairly unique device and that person would be easy to target. \r\r3. Who gets one? A village elder? The mayor of a town? One per family? Some framework for optimal distribution is required. \r\rI hope these are some good food-for-thought.

I love tough questions; hopefully, I can address yours sufficiently. \r\r1.You are correct this device does not guarantee a response from the international community, but I feel your critique is somewhat of a red herring. As you mentioned, the question was how to gather information from hard-to-access areas. The question you pose \"How might we guarantee an international response to humanitarian atrocities?\" would be a wonderful one to answer, but it is a separate and distinct question.\r\r2. You bring up an excellent point. Your idea to conceal the device in cell phones is really neat!  How about embedding the device in an AM/FM radio? Unlike cell phones, radio tuners are more common in these areas. \r\rIf your already facing the threat of mass violence, mass rape, or mass murder, your already under grave threat. Would having this device really make you any more of a target? \r\rSuch a scenario would provide for a rational choice calculus in which the cost of having the device is low, because your already subject to a zero-sum high cost. I hope this makes sense!  \r\r3. This is another great question. The goal would be 100% universal access to this device (scalability is certainly a point of criticism). In the interim, this tool could be distributed to critical nodes (village elders, courier networks, NGOs, etc.) within a socio-economic network as you suggested. \r\rThanks again, Michael!

As with the propaganda films employed by the Nazis, you can create a campaign that will instill a strong feeling in people and display this frequently throughout the community. A lot of research has been done in the fields of subliminal messaging and it's effectiveness. However, subliminal messaging carries a very negative connotation as it takes away people's conscious right to choose. Perception Without Awareness on the other hand is visible and is employed quite effectively. The field of NLP could be another way to go. For instance, if I tell you to not think of a dog. What is the first thing you do? You think of a dog. The reason for that is that the command, 'think of a dog' is embedded in the sentence.

Sorry for the double-comment]\r\rHi Richard, after considering the situational constraints you mentioned in the other thread, I've thought about this a bit more. If we take the most extreme circumstance, we have a group of people in a remote, hard-to-access area that is being blocked by hostile forces. Mobile and internet communications are down because the towers have been destroyed. Landlines are dead because the wires have been cut. These people are literally off the grid. \r\rSo, how can they be enabled to nonetheless send signals to each other and the outside world. If they are really remote enough, I think it is a safe assumption to say that some form of technology will be needed to communicate. Further, this technology should allow for two-way communication, i.e. communication by the people and not simply surveillance, as you say. So they will have to have some kind of technology, and they will have to get access to it. This means either they are provided with the tech before hostilities begin, or they are given it once they're cut off. The latter would be done either by infiltrating the area somehow, or more practically, flying tech in via airplanes or UAVs.\r\rGiven what you've described, it had also occurred to me to re-enable mobile and radio networks via UAVs providing this network. To decrease the chance they would be shot down, they should only be flown at night. I think the downside to this is that it would be expensive, both in the technology itself as well as having pilots to actually fly these things. So it feels more like a special ops kind of solution, if we want to talk to someone specifically, know they have a cellphone, and need to get them temporary network access.\r\rAnother approach that occurred to me that would be trying to tackle the same problem - disabled mobile networks - is instead of using UAVs to fly over areas, why not drop many small radio transmitters over an area that would form a mesh network to provide communication. This is inspired by RadioBlock that I just came across: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545073874/radioblock-simple-radio-for-arduino-or-any-embedde\r\rHonestly I'm not sure of the technical feasibility, but my (perhaps simplistic) thinking would go like this: if one could build a small, cheap radio transmitter built into a solar panel, these devices could be dropped intermittently (depending on their range) over a target area. If designed properly, they could get caught up and rest on top of dense forest canopy for example. If enough are dropped close to each other, they would form a mesh network that enables communication. \r\rThe benefits:\r1) Hard to locate and therefore disable\r2) Taking out one radio transmitter doesn't shut down the network\r3) Can be deployed remotely by plane or UAV at night\r4) Should be cheaper than a fleet of UAVs\r\rWhat do you think, did that make sense?\r\rIn general, I like the approach of trying of seeing how disabled networks could be re-enabled or replaced without having to enter a given geography.\r\rBy the way, thanks for the PirateBox example, I feel inclined to build one now.\r\rCheers, \r- Lee", "user": "c4558f788816d77283092189db039b7c", "date": "April 04, 2013, 12:02AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "pirate_communications", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Lee, I am on the road, so internet is presently limited to the phone, so I will repky quickly about the UAV comments and respond more fully when I can fire up the laptop.

Haha.\r\rOK, so quickly to the salient points:\r\rThe idea of the mesh network as part of a pirated communication network is a great addition. Perhaps, we can reach out to the individual with the other inspiration and collaborate. I have not personally played with mesh networks in a couple of years, so cost implications concern me based on my old knowledge. As technology improves, I am sure the costs of building mesh networks has decreased. \r\rLastly, as I briefly mentioned, the specific UAV platform I mentioned utilizes very small. These are not identical to the ones I mentioned, but the size is similar and the site contains a video. http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/robot-dragonfly-micro-aerial-vehicle\r\rI have not spoken to the creators of these to see if they could carry the wireless access platforms like the ones I mentioned; hence why I left them out in the initial. \r\rThe benefits of these UAVs are that they are as simple to operate as a remote controlled car, are whisper quiet, and under the right light scenarios (such as operating at night as you suggest), are almost impossible to detect visually. \r\rThe drawback I see for this type of deployment is that, at this point, I believe they all have to be operated line of sight, specifically meaning that the person with the remote has to be able to see the UAV. This is where I think getting the IDEO team involved to take the existing platform and trying to equip it with a night/IR camera that transmits back to a screen on the remote allowing the operator to be able to fly it without seeing it. Perhaps creating a remote hybrid that runs off of a smartphone would be a simple solution.

That is as one ant, or a couple ants, are going into a direction -  first only randomly - , and will always mark their way with pheromons indicting others to follow. What makes an ant to follow you is the strenght of the path of pheromons.\r\rAs long as there really is a source of food (signal=true) more ants will follow enforcing the layed path of pheromons attracting more ants (positive loop). As soon as the message turns out false, less ants will go there (regulation), the path of pheromons, getting weaker and finally disappearing (negative loop). So you see, nature implemented regulative measures. I am not sure whether the same is true for rumours which is a more human \"concept\" and seems more uncontrolled. \r\rThough not an expert on rumours I could imagine that rumours would also \"survive\" if it turned out false (or some people experienced them as not true).

However once the rumor turns out to be false or ambiguous, people will lay other trails to sources that may prove the opposite, which will again gain traction from the crowd. We lay our own paths of pheromones, if you like.\r\rI think the way rumors survive is through limited access to other information.

After a lot of work, I managed to find the locations of a large number of activist videos uploaded during the Syrian conflict (some from geotags, most from locations referenced and landmarks visible in the videos). Putting all this information together, it became very clear that these videos were originating from a few locations. It showed where the protests were (by neighborhood), where armed groups were forming, and had a lot of information related to where the activists were as well. This type of information in the hands of the regime would be a map of targets. Similarly, information about roadblocks, troop deployments, and the like could lead to further violence.\r\rInformation that would lead to increased safety, however, would be information related to conflict events, water or food shortages, and the like. This type of information would improve people's knowledge of what's happening around them (in the absence of free media), and would enable them to respond accordingly.\r\rMy comments regarding diversity were with respect to diversity of viewpoints available on the server. Because the algorithms used by Google and Twitter are designed to direct people to other people or things that are similar to themselves, most individuals aren't exposed to \"the other\" in conflict zones. While I'm still analyzing the effects of this phenomenon where I see it taking place, my initial assumption is that it leads to further entrenchment. Your system, by showing users a diverse array of conversation clusters would help prevent people from becoming stuck in their own cluster of like-minded people. *Of course, a system that draws upon only those conversations that take place online is inherently biased, but as the power of online conversations grow, recognizing and responding to the negative externalities of such a forum becomes even more important.", "user": "8b9528da3d9bb3ac0bbd455b04bdb725", "date": "May 16, 2013, 04:42PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "crisistracker_real_time_social_media_curation", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks.\r\rIf a software system is capable of collecting both information that can be used for good and for bad, mostly depending on configuration, do you see a problem with it being made available as open source?

In my experience, social media in general and Twitter in particular tends to focus on the immediate present. Based on the research of me and many others, I also believe that for some types of real-time information, Twitter can be a very fast, accurate and relatively rich source of live reports, as well as an accurate historical index of when different pieces of information became available.\r\rRegarding content curation, you also raise a fair point that human-based curation is indeed always associated with some level of latency. In the current version of CrisisTracker, this affects meta-data extraction, but keyword search and event detection (report clustering) are essentially immediate as these are automated processes. Current development efforts are therefore focused on shifting the workload of human curators from direct annotation of content, to training different types of machine classifiers. If these efforts work out, the system will be able to generate also meta-data in real-time.\r\rYour question thus ultimately boils down to the question of whether real-time situational awareness (SA) enables action or not. I believe SA is one fundamental component in most decision making, but I would greatly appreciate to get more feedback on the specific real-time information that is needed to make response decisions in conflict prevention. Perhaps some vital information isn't easily found on Twitter? Perhaps the information is there, but the user interface doesn't quite make it possible to find some particular content of interest quickly enough?

The neat thing about CT is that it's language agnostic, this is a great help esp with mining arabic and french tweets which seem to dominate Twitter-covered stories about Syria. As for the safety and privacy of the reports, CT assigns a unique number to the account tweeting the information and tracks its credibility over time, but never publishes the name or the location of the person [or entity] tweeting. We found this to also be incredibly helpful as it protects the identity of the eyewitness reporter, for example.

For each event there can be a range of evidence, similar the current stories, but the important difference is that repetition no longer is critical to infer information structure. With structured event data in place, the next step is to build visualizations that show how event types are distributed in space and time, and alert when new event types are detected.\r\rIn an event-based data model it is also far easier to fuse data from different communication channels. The idea to combine voice-based reporting with crowd-sourced annotation and/or automated speech-to-text is intriguing, and certainly something that will be kept in mind as the project proceeds. I think it would be particularly interesting if it can be combined with automated visualization.\r\rFinally, the preference is to move towards a system where humans set the standard for content curation, but where the system quickly learns to generalize and automate the curation behavior. There are three reasons for this. First, compared to other information domains, each humanitarian crisis is relatively unique. Therefore unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained for one event give very poor performance if used in future events. Second, human volunteer curators are available with short notice through for instance the Stand-By Task Force. Human curation can be very accurate, but burn-out is a significant problem and there is no way to sustain large work-forces for crises that last for weeks, months or even years. Third, no matter how many volunteers are recruited, they can never keep up with the rate at which social media content is generated. Even though the clustering in CrisisTracker reduces information inflow rates by several orders of magnitude, humans can still only keep up with around 1% of the stories. By learning from the human curators, the system can be both accurate and scalable.", "user": "75b6f4a87e463ddfe53a967106e99128", "date": "April 26, 2013, 06:45PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "crisistracker_real_time_social_media_curation", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Fascinating detail yet again, Jakob.

Regarding verification of information, I believe Syria Tracker has used the tool in the best way possible. They do not use any single source for verification, but rather triangulate reports across eyewitness reports from trusted sources on the ground, social media and mainstream media. Neither of these channels is good enough on its own, as trusted eyewitnesses are too few to cover a country, social media is brief and a bit sensational, and mainstream media is slow and has selective coverage. They also try to verify reports on a cause and effect basis, for instance by matching YouTube videos of missile launches with reports of impacts near the alleged time and place of the launch.\r\rCrisisTracker's role in this is mainly to\r1) provide cheap coverage of public citizen communication at country scale, and direct attention to current central topics;\r2) bring together scattered reports about the same event, to have a single (or a few) cluster(s) that forms a constantly updating index of the most shared images, videos, news articles and views from the different sides in a conflict.\r3) maintain history of social media communication, to enable triangulation also of past events. This is difficult to do using Twitter's own search, which is limited to recent content.\r\rRegarding clustering algorithms, CrisisTracker uses Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which is a very fast algorithm for kNN clustering in high-dimensional space. Words in the tweets are used as features, weighted by their inverse global frequency, with dynamic stop-word removal also based on frequency.

How can each region that uses CrisisTracker (CT) find out relavant information from it?  I could see an awesome prototype being researching the organizations who take preventative action in a region CT works and then doing some interviews with them to find out what type of info they act on and if CT could be tweaked or already fits into that category, then reporting back here those results.

So, hacking here would require some stealth strategy or program that can take the \"pulse\" of the network moment to moment, day to day, etc.without drawing attention to itself (assuming that active/tacit cooperation with the provider is not possible)\r\rAs noted below, most countries have large cities with networked phone/internet systems. Also as noted, a percentage of calls made within a (national or regional) network are made to outside networks. These outside the network calls can be monitored through collaboration with the provider, or, via a hacked program operating from within this outside network (what is 'hacked' here is the access point to the network traffic {total volume' operational state only, no eavesdropping per se} coming from the 'controlled network' (i.e., the network under control of an oppressive regime.)\r\rA secondary point here is that in any such country, it is likely that an atrocity would transpire far from the eyes of the masses -- in the more remote regions of a given country (e.g., in regions where a \"land grab\" may be occurring to secure/exploit dwindling resources) far from any access point to a large city's communication infrastructure. \r\rBut, individuals and small populations from these rural regions travel between cities and rural areas (e.g. seasonally, for agricultural harvests) quite frequently (as in parts of Africa), carrying news and information about conditions in the rural areas. So, there is this 'open channel' of person to person communication that could be utilized to get the word out (though it be slower, and piecemeal, perhaps).\r\rIf a ruling government seeks to stop this open channel, it can avail itself of one or all of the following options:\r\r1] It can try to intercept travel/travelers between remote areas and metropolitan areas\r\r2] it can try to prevent use of cell/computer networks (in the cities) to get information out of the country (i.e., a shutdown).\r\r3] It can do both.\r\rIn option #1 - accomplishing this means blockading migrant or nomadic persons from approaching urban locales. Assuming that these are primarily migrant farm workers (and thus useful, needed), the government might not wish to actually jail, harm or kill these people...only restrict their movements. This would be challenging and require a good deal of personnel to accomplish. Like the border patrols here in the US, no barrier or blockading force is going to prevent all entry or access (especially at night). Guards can be bribed, tricked, or diverted (or simply spread to thin in some larger nations). So, this option has limitations and weak spots, but could be modestly effective (for a time). Her is where one or more alert systems could come into play.\r\rIn option #2 - this shut down tactic will effect large numbers of people including business people who have contacts in government (and are source of income to corrupt militia or government leaders) and it is doubtful that such a shut down could go on for long without disrupting or destabilizing the society (fomenting discontent). Here is where the 'meta-monitoring' of outside network calling activity comes in. Any shut down would cease all calls to networks outside that (shut down) network and trigger an alert.\r\rIn option #3 - This would seem to be the least desirable option as it would require an expenditure of personnel and be highly disruptive to the society and it commerce. But in the event that this option is attempted, insofar as it would involve option # 2, it would still trigger an alert, given a hacked network/meta-monitoring effort already in place.\r\rMore thoughts on this to come!!!

These calls require 'crossing over' or connecting to other networks, either directly (network to network, via transponders)) or via cellular satellites.\r\rIn these cases, incoming calls to any given outside network should be amenable to monitoring in some form. Thus the receiving network (of calls made from outside; from another region or country's network) could be 'tagged' with a digital ID indicating its probable origin. All incoming calls from a given country can thus be identified and/or aggregated. At which point, a monitoring program can be established (by an outside org) to determine/average the calls from that country, and thereby establishing that \"baseline\" level of activity (averaged over days, weeks months, seasonally, etc.). At the very least, such monitoring could detect fairly immediately if incoming calls from a given country (based upon ID recognition) suddenly stopped altogether (indicating a possible government shutdown).\r\rThis would still require cooperation from other network providers (and possibly those who control/own the satellites that relay international calls), but this cooperation (regarding any transnational effort to stop mass atrocities) is a given. \r\rSo, this (above) would be an example of a \"meta monitoring\" system which I mentioned previously)\r\rAs to those regions where there is little or no network connectivity (and arguably more likely to be at risk for mass atrocities) ...this is more challenging. I do mention the possibility of \"mobile\" (bike/motor bike) networks using low power receiver/transmitter devices to transmit/route calls to the next nearest mobile receiver (say, in another village; note: maximum distance a cell or internet/wi-fi signal can travel in free space is about 9 or 10 miles)...realizing that this method requires more coordination with 'on the ground' supporters (mobile antenna operators, users, etc.)...In fact, such improvised mobile antenna networks are already functioning in many rural locales.\r\rSo, in this latter case, the \"baseline\" connectivity level would be much smaller than in a more 'networked' country, but would still exist and could be monitored remotely.\r\rThe alternative here is establishing a clandestine \"ham\" radio network that would transmit, automatically/autonomously, a \"beat\" signal ( a continuous pulse/signal) when in operation (regardless of human broadcasting). If such a radio network were powered by solar energy (especially in hot dry climates), there would be continuous transmission -- unless switched off or disconnected (from the power source) by the village/tribe operator (in a crisis) or destroyed by an invading militia. \r\rThus also, no great effort (like an actual broadcast) is required on behalf of the operators. Remote monitors of these beat frequency signals could then detect a shut down and alert human rights groups to a possible crisis unfolding.\r\rSimple to operate HAM radio kits (with 'auto-pilot' transmitters built in) could be air-dropped into regions at risk with instructions in one of several native languages (including audio recordings on auto-play audio chip devices)...with individual kits spread over a region (in known transmission distance increments) to establish the ground-based network.\r\rSo, this last possibility could mesh with the people's radio concept (listed elsewhere) with the ultimate goal simply being a basic, automatic signal transmission to \"the outside world\" which can be monitored remotely", "user": "7396fed059897381567b641625abf4d2", "date": "April 24, 2013, 05:29PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "knowing_by_numbers_monitoring_total_network_connectivity", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I like the idea though I think you are assuming that smart devices are actually in the places where most human rights abuses are occuring...an intersting way to lok at things though", "user": "6ec40564300edb326249dc3d052e5fc6", "date": "April 23, 2013, 11:02AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "knowing_by_numbers_monitoring_total_network_connectivity", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Randar - \rActually, I am not assuming that, entirely....this problem is addressed in the concept description (concept phase) listing and alluded to here; it is acknowledged that many folks in developing (primarily rural) populations either do not have mobile phones, or access to reliable networks.

Since the wifi sd cards makes it possible to have the data shared, one way to add redundancy would be to have copies of the disks on other pigeons as well. \r\r3) interesting that the pigeon can have it's homing location 'nullified' in a separate cage. I have been tempted to visit some of the race clubs here locally and talk to a few people. in #2 of the concept summary, my general thought of releasing the pigeons to larger cages every few days had more to do with the comfort of the animal- and then to be replaced every few weeks.

Maybe that was just his way of doing it. I'm sure the racing clubs can give more insight. Maybe in times of peace if they release the pigeons on a bi weekly schedule, it will be a good way to maintain their homing instinct. Alternatively, build the cages in such a way that they cannot see their surroundings and familiarize themselves with it. Maybe that way you can extend their homing instinct.

Unfortunately these same areas are also the ones hardest hit by genocide and civilian conflict. We cannot rely on any infrastructure put into these areas to be maintained and protected. Many of these areas are also extremely remote, sometimes thousands of kilometers from civilization, which makes maintaining any kind of system a nightmare. Cellular technology is making some inroads into most African countries now, but I suspect it will still be many years before any kind of saturation is reached.\r\rTo add to your land line comment, here in South Africa we have people who steal land lines for the copper. The park a vehicle over a manhole, and pull the cable out with one wheel lifted into the air, kinda like a fishing reel. Sometimes they steal kilometers of cable in a single go.

First, to move things beyond the general to the more specific, have you identified a specific kind (make, brand, etc.) of quadcopter that you would recommend? How long can it stay airborne, and how far / fast can it travel? This is a critical issue, as a quadcopter that can cover a radius of ten miles can be used in much different circumstances than one which can only cover a mile or two. \r\rSecond, and on a related point, it's useful to think of the quadcopter idea in terms of specific use-cases. Could an NGO or UN agency managing a refugee or internally displaced persons camp use a quadcopter to patrol the perimeter of the camp in the morning, to ensure that there are no militias around before women leave to collect firewood? Depending on the range, could a quadcopter be used (again, by an NGO or UN agency) to investigate reports that, say, a neaby village has been attacked and burned by an armed group? \r\rThird, I wouldn't focus too much on innovations that are, at the moment, technologically infeasible - a solar powered quadcopter is a great idea in theory, but do they currently exist? If not, I would focus on what can be done with the technology that's already out there. \r\rFourth, and a final point - how difficult is it to fly a quadcopter? Or, put differently, how much time does it take to learn? What does this imply about who will actually use these machines? (My sense is that the quadcopters can best be used by NGOs and UN agencies, as opposed to, say, community groups.)\r\rThanks so much for submitting this idea, and thrilled to see if move forward,\r\rMichael Kleinman\rHumanity United", "user": "387815d5695534699793b97fc4b1d291", "date": "May 03, 2013, 07:54PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "quadcopter_signal_network", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Michael,\r\rAll good points. I'll address them in order:\r\r1. There are many consumer- and prosumer-grade quadcopter models to choose from. They can vary from the very simple and cheap (>$100 Ladybird http://www.wowhobbies.com/ladybirdquadcopterarf.aspx) to the advanced and thus more expensive (~$2,000 Ace X830, http://www.wowhobbies.com/turboacex830-d-c-rtf-als2cm02-superstructuredevo10.aspx). Obviously, the cheapo versions won't give us the range or payload that we need. The high-end versions will let you carry 5lbs or more, but the cost may be prohibitive. There are plenty of mid-range models that are popular with consumers (~$700 DJI Phantom http://www.wowhobbies.com/dji-phantomdjiphantomrtfwithtransmitterandcharger.aspx), and I think that might be the best place to start for our purposes. They still come with a variety of camera mounts and payload capabilities, they include GPS standard, and they are more affordable. Cameras are extra, but almost all quadcopters have compatible mounts for cheap and rugged cameras such as the GoPro.\r\rAs for range and speed, the better models can fly in excess of 20mph/30kph, although that may be taxing for some models. Based on some simple math, and taking into account the average flight time across most models (usually a 30 minute max unless you include ridiculous amounts of backup batteries), I think that we should operate under the assumption that these quadcopters have a range limit of 5 miles. Like you said, this makes it more suited to excursions than long-term surveillance. \r\r2. Given the limitations of the technology, I think you are right that these quadcopters make excellent reconnaissance resources. They are perfect for sending out to check the safety of an area before civilians enter. I think that these are a perfect fit for an NGO that needs to check on a neighboring village. Even if the village is outside the operational range of the base, it's a trivial matter for someone to throw the copter in a car, or even on the back of a bike, travel to within a mile or two of the target, and send in the quadcopter drone. This keeps the investigator safe, and allows the investigator to view a large area.\r\r3. While I think the technology could be made, you're right, the quadcopter is already useful without getting too wild with innovations. Based on the payload limitations, I think we should stick with GPS and cameras as the main tools.\r\r4. This is question that is entirely contingent on trust. Actually learning how to fly the quadcopter is relatively easy. They are usually self stabilizing, so the biggest issue is learning how fast it can turn and practicing not bumping into things. In other words, the learning curve is relatively low, especially if it is used at higher altitudes instead of weaving through the jungle. So, yes, I think local community groups could easily pick a member of the community to practice with the quadcopter and be proficient within a couple days. But there may be a worry that they will not treat it well, not use it correctly or frequently enough, or possibly not have reliable resources to recharge the batteries. If any of these things could be an issue, they are still a powerful resource for NGOs and other organizations that want to use them in an organized way. \r\rIn short, these aren't a perfect solution, but they are a fantastic alternative to sending real people into dangerous situations, and the technology is reliable and advanced enough to be useful in most situations.

They are much more suited to the respond and verify methods you mention. Then a pilot could be on hand to watch the video feed in real time and respond to warning signs.\r\rAnother reason for this is that constant surveillance will probably engender animosity towards the quadcopters. Even people who could benefit from its intel would eventually feel mistrust towards them because they are always watching.

Region specific trade disruption--in Congo this could be shortages of charcoal\r\rI believe PEP kits are a unique indicator, because whereas blood transfusions are needed after traffic accidents, for severe anemia from malaria and during operations, PEP kits with STD treatment and emergency contraception are only for sexual violence.  Unlike border-crossings, the usage of a PEP kit signifies violence within the last 72 hours.\r\rI will take a look at the links.

The trick will be making the programs easy to deploy, developing simple content generation guides and most importantly making sure the programs address the challenge objectives of preventing mass atrocities and gathering information should conflict arise.\r\rRegarding monitoring the radio waves for propaganda: This thought is tied to the aspect of the challenge that assumes a government body has banned reporters and observers. How might we get information about what's going on behind closed doors? At that point, the observer be it a DJ on the inside or reporters/observers at an USAID post would simply listen to and record rhetoric about that incites hate crimes or encouraged violent acts against particular groups etc. Based on the video above and other accounts, this type of language usually goes far beyond simple political, partisan chatter.

At that point posting on a common bulletin board or forum monitored by relevant organizations and the media.  That would at least solve the cell network problem.

You can pick one up for about $20 to $50 at Radio Shack, and no license is required to operate it.\rHam radio: To converse over these radios, also known as \"amateur radios,\" you have to obtain an operator's license from the FCC. Luckily, other Wired How-To contributors have already explained exactly what you need to do to get one and use it like a pro. However, if the President declares a State of Emergency, use of the radio could be extremely restricted or prohibited.\rGMRS: The General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a licensed land-mobile FM UHF radio service in the United States available for short-distance two-way communication. It is intended for use by an adult individual who possesses a valid GMRS license, as well as his or her immediate family members... They are more expensive than the walkie talkies typically found in discount electronics stores, but are higher quality.\rFamily Radio Service: The Family Radio Service (FRS) is an improved walkie talkie radio system authorized in the United States since 1996. This personal radio service uses channelized frequencies in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. It does not suffer the interference effects found on citizens' band (CB) at 27 MHz, or the 49 MHz band also used by cordless phones, toys, and baby monitors.\rMicrobroadcasting: Microbroadcasting is the process of broadcasting a message to a relatively small audience. This is not to be confused with low-power broadcasting. In radio terms, it is the use of low-power transmitters to broadcast a radio signal over the space of a neighborhood or small town. Similarly to pirate radio, microbroadcasters generally operate without a license from the local regulation body, but sacrifice range in favor of using legal power limits.\rPacket Radio Back to the '90s: There do exist shortwave packet-radio modems. These are also excruciatingly slow, but may get your e-mail out. Like ham radio above it requires a ham radio license because they operate on ham radio frequencies.\rPhone\r\rSet up a phone tree: According to the American Association of University Women, a phone tree is \"a prearranged, pyramid-shaped system for activating a group of people by telephone\" that can \"spread a brief message quickly and efficiently to a large number of people.\" Dig out that contact list you printed out and follow the steps on the AAUW website to spread the message down your pyramid of contacts.\rEnable Twitter via SMS: Though the thought of unleashing the Twitter fire hose in your text message inbox may seem horrifying, it would be better than not being able to connect to the outside world at all. The Twitter website has full instructions on how to redirect tweets to your phone.\rCall to Tweet: A small team of engineers from Twitter, Google and SayNow, a company Google acquired recently, made this idea a reality. Its already live and anyone can tweet by simply leaving a voicemail on one of these international phone numbers (+16504194196 or +390662207294 or +97316199855) and the service will instantly tweet the message using the hashtag #egypt. No Internet connection is required. People can listen to the messages by dialing the same phone numbers or going to the Twitter account, speak2tweet.\rAlex Jones and infowars.com have a telephone number for people to listen to his radio show by phone, in case the internet goes down, or if you don't have internet. The phone in listen line is 512-646-5000.\rFax\r\rIf you need to quickly send and receive documents with lengthy or complex instructions, phone conversations may result in misunderstandings, and delivering the doc by foot would take forever. Brush the dust off that bulky old machine, establish a connection by phone first with the recipient to make sure his machine is hooked up, then fax away.\rYou may not need a fax machine to send or receive faxes if your computer has a dial-up fax application.\rNon-Virtual Bulletin Board\r\rSometimes we get so wrapped up in the virtual world that we forget about resources available in the real world. Physical bulletin boards have been used for centuries to disseminate information and don't require electricity to function. If you are fortunate enough to be getting information from some other source why not share it with your friends and neighbors with your own bulletin board? Cork, magnetic and marker bulletin boards are as close as your nearest dime store and can be mounted just about anywhere. And if push comes to shove you can easily make your own with scrap wood lying around the house.\rGetting back online\r\rWhile it might be relatively easy for a government to cut connections by leveraging the major ISPs, there are some places they wouldn't get to so readily, like privately-owned networks and independent ISPs.\rFind the privately-run ISPs\r\rIn densely populated areas, especially in central business districts and city suburbs there are multiple home WiFi networks overlapping each other, some secure, some not. If there is no internet, open up your WiFi by removing password protection: If enough people do this it's feasible to create a totally private WiFi service outside government control covering the CBD, and you can use applications that run Bonjour (iChat on Mac for example) to communicate with others on the open network and send and receive documents. **needs more clarification\rIf you are a private ISP, it's your time to shine. Consider allowing open access to your Wi-Fi routers to facilitate communication of people around you until the grid is back online.\rReturn to dial-up\r\rAccording to an article in the BBC about old tech's role in the Egyptian protests, \"Dial-up modems are one of the most popular routes for Egyptians to get back online. Long lists of international numbers that connect to dial-up modems are circulating in Egypt thanks to net activists We Re-Build, Telecomix and others.\"\rDial-up can be slow. Often, there is a lightweight mobile version of a site that you can load from your desktop browser quickly despite the limitations of dial-up. Examples: mobile.twitter.com, m.facebook.com, m.gmail.com.\rAd-Hoc Networking\r\rMost wireless routers, PCs, laptops, and even some ultramobile devices like cellphones have the ability to become part of an \"ad hoc\" network, where different \"nodes\" (all of the devices on the network) share the responsibility of transmitting data with one another. These networks can become quite large, and are often very easy to set up. If used properly by a tech-savvy person, such networks can be used to host temporary websites and chat rooms. There are many internet tutorials on the internet for ad hoc networking, so feel free to google some.\rApple computers tend to have very accessible ad hoc functionality built in, including a pre-installed chat client (iChat) that will automatically set up an ad hoc \"Rendezvous\" chatroom among anybody on the network, without the need for an external service like AIM or Skype. Ad hoc network-hosting functionality is built in to the Wi-Fi menu.\rWindows computers have several third-party ad hoc chat applications available (such as Trillian) and setting up an ad hoc Wi-Fi network is almost as simple as on a Mac.\rLinux operating systems, of course, have plenty of third-party apps available, and most distros have ad hoc network-creation support built in.\rBuild Large Bridged Wireless Network\r\rUsing popular wireless access point devices like a Linksys WRT54G, you can create a huge wireless bridged network -- effectively creating a Local Area Network (LAN), or a private Internet that can be utilized by all users within range using a Wi-Fi enabled device.\rYou can also link multiple devices together wirelessly, extending the range of your network. Most access points will cover a 100 meter area and if your wireless device is built to support the 802.11n wireless standard, you will get almost a 500 meter coverage area for each access point.\rTo build a wireless bridge, check out the dd-wrt wiki, and learn how to configure Linksys WRT54G as a wireless client using this Anandtech thread.\rNintendo DS\r\rA used DS family device can be purchased inexpensively. In addition to wi-fi, the DS supports its own wireless protocols. Using Pictochat, it is possible to chat with nearby DS users without having any DS games. Unfortunately, the range is quite short.\rSome games, such as the fourth generation Pokemon games, support mail items. Thus you can send your message under the guise of just playing a game. Mail items can be sent through the Internet if you can get on the net and you and your partner(s) have each other's friend codes.\rThe original DS and the DS Lite do support the Opera web browser, but finding the game card and memory pack may be very difficult. Starting with the DSi, Opera is downloadable.\rIntranet\r\rYour computer has the ability to set up your own INTRANET. This was done BEFORE the internet was popularized in two ways: Your computer dialed up other computers and sent them the contents of a message board, or local people people dialed into your computer. A nationwide system can be set up this way with a central location sending to many cities then each city sending out the info locally.\rBecome untraceable\r\rIf you're going to post government secrets on your work-around site, you may want to set up an untraceable account. Really, you only need a mail drop, an assumed name, a prepaid credit card you can get at many stores to set up service.\rGet satellite access\r\rYou can have very, very slow internet if you have something similiar to an Iridium phone, which would allow you to do dial up at 2400 baud, which at least gives you e-mail. This will also work when your government has shut down GSM and telephone access, and will work pretty much anywhere on the planet. If you're in the right place, get yourself KA-SAT access which is satellite broadband and will not be routed through any internet exchange that certain local governments may monitor or block (unless that government is part of EU or er ...

The most important thing is to transfer technical knowledge by having a local partner / coordinator who can assist the participants.

The verification process you outlined reminds me of Hunchwork: http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/inspiration/un-global-pulse-hunchworks-protecting-vulnerability/\rwhich was started a couple of years ago. \r\rSMS is an easy and popular way to send messages, especially when internet access is not available. I would also suggest giving people options to \"flash call\" where they call and hang up. This way they don't have to use their data plan or use up their minutes if there was a number they can call and hang up for reporting.

What I really like with Hunchworks is that is allows people to develop and verify hypotheses and provides readers with gradations of verifyability. A really neat analytical process (although one should make sure that alternative hypotheses are not disregarded - probably tought of but not clear from video) It mostly relies on the internet though (at least at this stage from what I could see from the video), but I guess that my idea to use SMS and have people structuring their information could definitively be integrated into a platform such as Hunchworks, and become an additional channel of information and verification. \rAs for Flash calls, great idea. I was thinking along a similar line, such as getting into an agreement with tel providers to allow users to send free SMS to a particular number. SMS would be paid by the organization running the platform, so people won't have to use their credit. But probably the same idea, I guess. \rIn short, anyway, what I propose is more like a method that could be used on a series of platforms. The idea is to get as much relevant data as possible and permit/facilitate verification, again using low tech such as SMS. SMS info would come on top of aggregation of (and semantically enhancing) info from other media, like CrisisTracker (used by SyriaTracker) is doing, allowing to corroborate info from SMS with other info from news media, tweets (but not great since max 140 char.) etc. \rWritting quickly from work.

You made me think, immediately, of Amartya Sen's book, \"Identity and Violence,\" and then, when I went to pull the book off my bookshelf, I saw next to it Tariq Ramadan's \"What I Believe,\" also relevant, and also good to think with, though a bit more controversial in the US. I realize I should share ideas and not books here, but many of my ideas come from books, so here's a quote from Sen's book that might be useful to the conversation you inspire (and yes, I am quoting at length because I think this is of key importance (particularly the last paragraph) to the challenge we are intending to address):\r\r. . . In our normal lives, we see ourselves as members of a variety of groups--we belong to all of them. The same person can be, without any contradiction, an American citizen, of Caribbean origin, with African ancestry, a Christian, a liberal, a woman, a vegetarian, a long-distance runner, a historian, a schoolteacher, a novelist, a feminist, a heterosexual, a believer in gay and lesbian rights, a theater lover, an environmental activist, a tennis fan, a jazz musician, and someone who is deeply committed to the view that there are intelligent beings in outer space with whom it is extremely urgent to talk (preferably in English). Each of these collectivities, to all of which this person simultaneously belongs, gives her a particular identity. None of them can be taken to be the person's only identity or singular membership category. Given our inescapably plural identities, we have to decide on the relative importance of our different associations and affiliations in any particular context.\rCentral to leading a human life, therefore, are the responsibilities of choice and reasoning. In contrast, violence is promoted by the cultivation of a sense of inevitability about some allegedly unique--often belligerent--identity that we are supposed to have and which apparently makes extensive demands on us (sometimes of a most disagreeable kind). The imposition of an allegedly unique identity is often a crucial component of the \"martial art\" of fomenting sectarian confrontation.\rUnfortunately many well-intentioned attempts to stop such violence are also handicapped by the perceived absence of choice about our identities, and this can seriously damage our ability to defeat violence. When the prospect of good relations among different human beings are seen (as they increasingly are) primarily in terms of \"amity among civilizations\" or \"dialogue between religious groups\" or \"friendly relations between different communities\" (ignoring the great many ways in which people relate to each other), a serious miniaturization of human beings precedes the devised programs for peace.

I'm one of the people that thinks we might use this idea of big data for this challenge, but I also realize that we do not have the same time of data available, as in 'connected' societies. This is also exactly what I wanted to explore with the inspiration I posted (and you linked to with this one). I think to do so, we need to explore two things: on one hand we need to figure out what data there is available, and from which sources. This is highly likely to be not at all like the purchasing history of a smartphone wielding and loyalty card waving consumer. I was thinking about things like MPesa transactions (as suggested in an inspiration Sarah shared), maybe connections to and traffic on GSM networks where available, but also aerial photos (maybe someone is working on a project for National Geographic), commercial sattelites (Google?) and maybe pictures from tourist/adventurers. Then there's things like 'radio stations'. Maybe if we can find some way to see if radio transmission suddenly increase or decrease in a certain area. Or something as simple as finding out whether produce is no longer coming to a market in a 'safe area'. If a regular farmer suddenly stops sending his produce to a certain market (or how that goes in these areas) that might be a sign something is wrong. Another thing worth considering, is sudden migration patterns of wild animals. In areas where there's suddenly more violence between humans, animals might flee and seek safer grounds somewhere else.\rAnd this leads me to the second area of exploration: what are the sign we can find in previous atrocities or events of violence against civilians, and what can we learn from them. How can we interpret the data that is available to us?\r\rI look forward to work on an idea for this in the idea phase, and look forward to collaborating with you further!", "user": "6fed0e6f1ba44f0520bc14fceee3663d", "date": "March 20, 2013, 10:17PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "is_the_data_big_enough", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I guess what I want to say: data sources do not need to be digital to contain valuable information.

You comment seems to assume that said access is a given, or readily available, when in fact in may not be (or, there may not be sufficient time to access imaging data to make a determination of an atrocity; access to satellite data is restricted and highly coveted, human rights not withstanding).\r\rPlus, there is the issue of real-time data acquisition and analysis, which complicates the issue of simple \"access\"\r\rSo, my small suggestion of boosting a micro-sat into low earth orbit may be a bit impractical (but not unfeasible), but it is an idea (and there are others) that should not be dismissed so easily given that access to satellite data is restricted (as noted).\r\rAs for prevention...yes, of course, it would be best to \"prevent\" an atrocity -- that's why we are all here! However, the point is that we can not prevent all such atrocities (for many reasons), thus, the idea becomes, ALERTING outsiders to a crisis unfolding. \r\rIn this context (alerting through use of satellites), one must certainly look for indicators of a crisis; I suggested (as an example) using night time lights (cooking stoves, lamps, camp fires, etc.) as proxy indicators of a mass movement (assuming that it is not a farm worker migration), for example, a mass exodus from an atrocity area. This is an entirely likely / plausible  occurrence (i.e, refugees fleeing en masse),and the use of night time lights tracking by satellites has already been field tested/validated in the context of tracking disease epidemics/outbreaks. This is a valid approach and your comment doe sin no way negate it.\r\rYes, an atrocity is often the result of an escalation of tensions (that have been present or fomenting for awhile)...but think: how should this 'escalation of tensions\" be monitored, interpreted, and then, how shall said escalating tensions be communicated to those who would prevent an atrocity?

I agree that this is a topic we need to address. Great thinking, Ashwin.\r\rAs Anne-Laure mentioned below, I'm also struggling a bit with this. In my view, I think the fundamental issue is control over resources (to guarantee survival of the genes in an evolutionary sense). And in most of these conflicts, it's often a limited group of people who want that, and then either lure or force others to fight for them.\rForcing is one whole separate issue, but the luring is something that might be made more difficult, if people have better economic possibilities. For them then, survival is less likely when they join the fight, which might make them not as likely to join in.\rI think that differences are part of that luring process: the bigger the differences between groups seem, the likelier it is their members want to take up arms. But, when there's an economic incentive to overlook these differences, they become less prominently troublesome.\rYou can see it in Europe now. The EU was funded on the idea that economic cooperation would make the continent less prone to armed conflict. And it has proved that this approach can work. However, during the economic crisis that still isn't over, you see that differences (religion, ethnic backgrounds, but also based on nationality within the EU) are mentioned more often and made bigger by politicians.\rAt least, that's my interpretation of power, armed conflict and current political trends in EU.\r\rAnyway, it's a great inspiration you post here, and I think the comments section here can be a good place to start the discussion.

Yet, I think we will then also need to unpack the sources of power and look into Tajfel's  social identity theory.

Those with previous knowledge of an area (e.g., where villages are/were, where agricultural migrants cluster, etc.) would be key to help assess any change(s) from the normal (like seasonal work migration) that might indicate conflict. \r\rNote that it is nearly as important to track disease outbreaks (which could lead to an epidemic) as it is to track conflict outbreaks (which could lead to all out war). Epidemiologists need access to imagery in short time in order to analyze and notify public health authorities and take protective measures in time. \r\rLikewise, preventing mass atrocities (or stopping them before they escalate) by alerting human rights groups of possible conflict outbreaks will require quick access to such imagery (again, a new collaboration is needed here).\r\rAlternatively, in the absence of such a dedicated (24/7) team, a \"many eyes\" approach examining satellite imagery (and this would have to be, if not 'real-time' imagery then 12-24 hour refreshed/updated imagery, to be truly preventative) such as is done currently with \"citizen scientists\" projects (like those on the website Zooniverse.com).\r\rA similar website with a satellite image database could be used to track possible signs of armed conflict outbreaks (experts would devise a brief tutorial for volunteers to take so that the tiresome job of viewing thousands of images can be spread out over a large group (and \"many eyes miss few lies\"). The \"citizen atrocity preventers\" would collectively scan these images for general, tell-tale signs and note these through the user interface.

If we take the most extreme circumstance, we have a group of people in a remote, hard-to-access area that is being blocked by hostile forces.  Mobile and internet communications are down because the towers have been destroyed.  Landlines are dead because the wires have been cut.  These people are literally off the grid.  \r\rSo, how can they be enabled to nonetheless send signals to each other and the outside world.  If they are really remote enough, I think it is a safe assumption to say that some form of technology will be needed to communicate.  Further, this technology should allow for two-way communication, i.e. communication by the people and not simply surveillance, as you say.  So they will have to have some kind of technology, and they will have to get access to it.  This means either they are provided with the tech before hostilities begin, or they are given it once they're cut off.  The latter would be done either by infiltrating the area somehow, or more practically, flying tech in via airplanes or UAVs.\r\rGiven what you've described, it had also occurred to me to re-enable mobile and radio networks via UAVs providing this network.  To decrease the chance they would be shot down, they should only be flown at night.  I think the downside to this is that it would be expensive, both in the technology itself as well as having pilots to actually fly these things.  So it feels more like a special ops kind of solution, if we want to talk to someone specifically, know they have a cellphone, and need to get them temporary network access.\r\rAnother approach that occurred to me that would be trying to tackle the same problem - disabled mobile networks - is instead of using UAVs to fly over areas, why not drop many small radio transmitters over an area that would form a mesh network to provide communication.  This is inspired by RadioBlock that I just came across: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545073874/radioblock-simple-radio-for-arduino-or-any-embedde\r\rHonestly I'm not sure of the technical feasibility, but my (perhaps simplistic) thinking would go like this: if one could build a small, cheap radio transmitter built into a solar panel, these devices could be dropped intermittently (depending on their range) over a target area.  If designed properly, they could get caught up and rest on top of dense forest canopy for example.  If enough are dropped close to each other, they would form a mesh network that enables communication. \r\rThe benefits:\r1) Hard to locate and therefore disable\r2) Taking out one radio transmitter doesn't shut down the network\r3) Can be deployed remotely by plane or UAV at night\r4) Should be cheaper than a fleet of UAVs\r\rWhat do you think, did that make sense?\r\rIn general, I like the approach of trying of seeing how disabled networks could be re-enabled or replaced without having to enter a given geography.\r\rBy the way, thanks for the PirateBox example, I feel inclined to build one now.\r\rCheers, \r- Lee", "user": "c4558f788816d77283092189db039b7c", "date": "April 03, 2013, 11:58PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "wireless_internet_on_the_fly_other_mobile_communications_technology", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Richard,\r\rI could see this innovation coupled with surveillance, an alert system, and a mobile hot spot.

Plus, they would not be subject to international politics the same way the surveillance UAVs are, which opens up a plethora of different implementation options as a complete stand alone system or as part of a complete support package.

To assess the flow of money in the system and get a sense of average prices per certain-weight shoats, we created simple charts with fill-in-the-blank spaces for recording every shoat's age, weight, expected sale price by the pastoralist, actual sale price, how many sheep and goats were brought to market by the pastoralist, how many they ended up selling. All of these numbers were deposited into Excel to get averages. \r\r2. BUT, all of these numbers wouldn't be very useful in helping us make our recommendations without our qualitative interviews with local people, learning about the incentives for how, when and why they sell their sheep and goats, why they want to keep their wealth on hoof (versus in a bank, for instance), grazing practices, animal care practices, how they prepare for drought and how drought has affected them in general. We did 0.5-1-hour interviews with couples and individuals at their homes some distance away from markets, and shorter interviews with people at markets. With little exception the locals were friendly and open to speaking with us through a translator, typically a community member involved with the local wildlife conservancy whom the interviewees new and trusted. \r\rOur top recommendation dealt with raising the overall health of their sheep and goats through the sales and distribution of inexpensive animal health kits that included the main vaccines, syringes and a pictoral guide to administering medicine. Our statistical research found that the average 2-year-old shoat in Northern Kenya was much smaller than a typically healthy one. And our qualitiative research led us to learn about wide discrepancies in animal care and also we learned that people would likely be willing and able to pay a small amount to raise healthy animals that would fetch a higher price at market.\r\rAfter all that text, my takeaway message here is that you need to understand behavioral incentives in the way a community lives and interacts with each other and other tribes before making any recommendations -- and using a translator prominent in the community makes obtaining these in-person interviews possible. \r\rI also should mention this project was done with Northern Rangelands Trust, a fantastic organization of 20+ wildlife conservancies in Northern Kenya.", "user": "e235f430a8d62567bf8f2a209f72206e", "date": "March 22, 2013, 07:32PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "where_s_the_gossip_in_northern_kenya_at_the_shoat_market_1", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Ariel for a great piece of information.\r\rReading your inspiration, I could not help thinking of a couple of inspirations including the watercooler inspiration: http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/inspiration/shared-interests-and-the-watercooler-effect/ \r\rI also made me think of 2 inspirations I posted on how information is shared in different contexts, which led to many interesting discussions:\rhttp://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/inspiration/epidemics-and-rumors-from-horses-to-cell-phones/\rhttp://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/inspiration/of-wars-and-rumors-of-wars/\r\rWhat I think your piece highlights is the importance of informal gatherings, the need to understand local contexts and the need to understand the informal structure of communities and the \"connectors\" in these communities.\r\rOn the methodology: I cannot agree more on the importance of understanding the context and the need for qualitative interviews (and observations) to provide a rich understanding of the situation.

I imagine the handheld device having this same tracking ability- a small handheld gps/radio/pager type device, in a mesh network. Each device keeps track of other users in a 5 mile radius and relays this data to other devices in proximity. \r\rso the decentralized approach is definitely the way to go in addressing Richard's point about how easy it is to take down networks with visible antennas- here the 'hubs' would be a vulnerable point. The Bitcoin is a successful example here, as a peer 2 peer network in which each node holds an instance/history of every transaction to date while keeping each node unique. I imagine this system to be slow to update between nodes that are furthest from each other but it would be effectively decentralized.\r\rAt one end of the mesh, there would be an internet gateway (all the way on the west coast of africa for example), where social apps could connect to the rest of the world to the info on the ground. long distances between communities would have to be bridged somehow using repeaters, or possibly using the same handheld devices hidden in trees every few miles in line of sight.. just a few thoughts..;)", "user": "c2013d7889d3bb62f1954772ea3c2f34", "date": "April 06, 2013, 11:29PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "a_social_network_app_for_packet_radio_devices", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi David, \r\rI was also mulling over the connectivity issue - I'd like to hear your thoughts. \r\rIs it technically feasible for each APRS handheld device to be a repeater themselves? \r\rIf an APRS device has a radius range of 5 miles. The device would approximately cover a circular area of 78 miles correct? (pi * R^2)\r\rTheoretically you would only need 910 handheld APRS devices to cover the entire area of Syria. 71,000 square miles / 78 = 910.

This is only limited by the size of the antenna/power of the radio. And yes, an APRS device can be configured to act purely as a repeater. they are called digipeaters. In fact, handheld devices have been used as digipeaters, \rbut unfortunately APRS is not suitable for having hundreds of users on one frequency. It would be useful for example to have several patrol cars using APRS in an area of tens of miles surrounding the community. But it would not be a good idea to have hundreds of beaconing stations in this same area on one frequency. \r\rHowever, we can look at those simple protocols as simple workable models- but in a mesh- where the coordinates and the coordinates of others are relayed simultaneously on every device.

I further believe that this action can only be an initiator for some follow-up actions that have to happen and I would love to build on that in the next phase. Lastly - without wanting to get to philosophical - I think that light in its very essence is the symbol of hope. The best example is the tribute of light at ground zero but the concept was also used in several movies: Batman sign above Gotham city as symbol that the city is protected (banal but the line of thinking behind is the same). I think, especially in such desperate situations, this also might have some positive effects on the human soul.\r\rHope to see as much of you as possible in the next phase as I am curious how we can take that further.

What an interesting concept!  Have you heard of Harvard's Project Implicit?  This might seem unrelated, but I think there's a connection...  They do research to measure the effect of our implicit biases towards certain people and social groups.  Their sister site Project Implicit Mental Health measures the biases held by people with mental illness and the effect that treatment has on these biases.  They have a tool called the Implicit Association Test.\r\rhttps://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/pimh/index.jsp\r\rThe test can measure certain association that run under the surface of our conscious mind -- \"thoughts that exist outside conscious awareness and conscious control.\"  Check it out -- the research they do is scientifically rigorous and very interesting.\r\rSo, why is this relevant to your idea?  They have found that people that associate themselves more with the word \"death\" than the word \"life\" are more likely to commit, or attempt to commit, suicide.  This is not all that surprising.  BUT, they found that the outcome of the test, predicted future suicidal behavior BETTER than the therapists's prediction, the patient's prediction, and past behavior.  \r\rOkay, so I'm finally connecting the dots...  Just like the fact that children's drawings are known for honestly and transparently communicating their feelings and experiences of their situation, this test could be another great tool to understand what people are feeling beyond what they are willing to say.  We could identify the strength of the association between a person's community and negative emotions  (fear or violence) compared to positive associations (peace and happiness).

My initial response is in line with Amanda Dobson's input about local involvement. The most successful liberation movements in history, e.g. Underground Railroad, Indian Liberation, Modern Civil Rights Movement, were built and controlled from the inside out, with insiders driving the movements, and outsiders (OFI-OFOs) assisting. Though the inside leaders - like MLK - were at extreme risk, their internal support networks were strong enough to continue when leadership was compromised. I think Red Flag, therefore, needs a \"no-tech\" component focused on building underground tag-team style communications networks of local leaders and citizens within at-risk communities. The networks could be structured in a crystalline pattern that allows individuals to pass information to each other directly and discreetly across geographic areas using multiple paths - around, across, inside-out, up (as with Christina Saavedra's wonderful red ballon idea) - with the ultimate objective of reaching an OFI-OFO. Pre-crisis network development towards this objective would be a critical part of the process. Also, you may want to incorporate GIS software into the plan to help with OFI-OFO location mapping. Beyond that I ask, when Red Flags are raised, what then is the plan for intervention?", "user": "4bac5aa14f78fea042c603f2946504cc", "date": "May 31, 2013, 06:05AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "raise_a_red_flag", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Awesome news about a potential pilot, Joshua!

Really glad to be part of your team and congrats on getting shortlisted.  I've got some people from my previous virtual team that might be willing to join here if you like.  They bring various technical skills as well as working with developing networks of people and the issue of incentivizing without tainting results.  \r\rWe found a couple things in our work so far. Some of this might be repetitive to your idea and others postings and  - but I'll just throw it out there. \r1 - There are a lot of people working in rural areas through humanitarian and development organizations that can be trained to be data collectors. They have limited access sometimes - but they have access.\r2 - The people who give data want to receive the analysis back themselves. We were told right in the beginning of our work that the local people were tired of being asked to give data and then never seeing anything in return.  So giving them special access to the data and involvement in analysis has been critical. We even distribute hard copies of reports back into local communities where the people do not have internet access.  (I am throwing around the term \"local\" when I should be more careful - as there are several layers up from individuals within impacted communities)\r3 - No type of data is perfect - Quant data is often lagging, surveys and polls can be subjective, content analysis can have a media bias, etc. Data triangulation is a great way to get at what is really going on. If various sets of data say the same thing, then one assumes higher accuracy.  \r4 - Data layering is great for creating visualizations of data that can't be combined.  I would love to see your Red Flags concept as a layer of data on top other data - so that the human rights incidences being reported can be taken into context.  Additionally, I would be interested in having them report beyond just active human rights abuses and include anything they feel like people should know about and don't feel will otherwise be reported.\r5 - After awhile people get tired of \"early warning\".  If they don't see any response, they will stop sending data.  The mechanism must have some aspects of response associated with it.  We've been lucky that a major NGO and others are actually using the data from our platform to do baseline assessments, site and issue selection, and M&E.  Having our network aware that their data generation is related to humanitarian/development responses is extremely valuable.\r6 - Getting the resources out to the local communities in the rural areas for them to develop their own responses is the next challenge we are working on. Figuring out how to have a small grants program with all of the issues of absorptive capacity, ability to report on use of finances, how to determine success, how to create local ownership while also maintaining and encouraging standards that will be new to the local area without a constant presence.  But we think the rural areas need to own the solutions. National NGOs need to learn, as do international NGOs, that locals need to have ownership if the solution is going to be sustainable.  We've actually taken this learning from community development managers of major mining companies who saw hospital after hospital that they built and were asked to build sit empty, unused, and eventually crumble. When they asked what was needed, the answer would be \"a new hospital\".  \r7 - Having layers of access to the data can be one way to make sure potential responders have access while protecting sources.  Also, some people may put too much detail into their descriptions, like people's names.  We always have an initial scrub of the data for protection of people before anyone can see it. Only trained network members have access to that scrubbed data.  Then the data is taken to another, higher level, which is available to the public. We're able to dig into it if necessary but this has been an incentive for one to participate in the network while allowing the data to also be publicly available. \r\rSorry for ramble.

Moreover, the US lacks military presence in many countries. For instance, there is only one military base in all of Africa. The rest of the responsibility falls to the military located in Germany.\r\rAdditionally, U.S. Agents are many times on sensitive missions, which would limit their ability to report. Even with being anonymous, sending out reports can place an agent on the radar of the local country, which could ruin the mission. \r\rAs for diplomats, there are some locations that are absent of US diplomats. For example, Somalia, the entire diplomatic mission to that country is run out of Nairobi, Kenya. Madagascar is a country where we recently ceased diplomatic missions and there is not a full time US military presence there either. \rFurthermore, all of these individuals normally have fairly heavy work schedules that will limit the amount of time they can spend on creating detailed reports. \r\r2)  \r\rExpecting highly visible companies like Coca Cola to get involved is ambitious for a couple of reasons. First, a company may want to help, but considered their positions in the local economy they will likely attempt to remain neutral.  For example, as seen in Googles operations in China, Google honored the Chinese governments requirement to restrict web access to the Chinese people, in spite of its open opposition to the restriction of information, in order to continue operating.  If the issue is generated from the government, then a company taking sides against that government would surely become a target; not something a company wants to do. Whether that is right is another issue.  L\r\rLastly, many of the multinational corporations distribution networks often rely on third-party local subcontractors. Basically, what this does is limits the larger organizations ability to assist. Whats more, local companies may not want to be involved due to fears of retribution or it is even possible that some of these businesses may be ran by relative of members of the government or the government itself.  \r\rHow can these issues be mitigated or resolved?", "user": "8cefdb8d76388b7d398584b7af25f9d5", "date": "April 28, 2013, 10:56PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "raise_a_red_flag", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Michael, you raise some important risks, and I really appreciate the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of your feedback :)\r\rWhile several of my examples used US-based companies/NGOs and US governmental agencies, I never intended to restrict the pool of potential participants to only those from America. I think that by diversifying and seeking the participation of organizations and individuals from other countries, we could reduce the risk that all potential flag-raisers are expelled if the US government's relationship with a country sours.\r\rAnother way to mitigate this risk is by noting not just the reports that do come out of a particular country, but also those that don't. Two other concepts ('Beacon' and 'Knowing by Numbers') provide blueprints for how unexpected, significant drops or changes in data coming from an area can be nearly as informative as the reports that do.\r\rAs the OpenIDEO team mentioned below, a third way to mitigate the risk you've raised is to track proxy measures and metrics (e.g., crop prices) that can give us insight about what's going on in an area when direct reports are unreliable or absent.\r\rYour point about visible companies potentially being reluctant to participate is also well-taken. I think this can be mitigated two ways: 1. By incentivizing the organizations to participate (e.g., Kiran's idea to position it as a way to exercise social responsibility, shaming those who don't participate by publishing a prestigious list of companies that do, etc.). 2. By simultaneously targeting the individual employees themselves and reassuring them that reports remain anonymous. That way, even if Coca-Cola the company doesn't participate, Coca-Cola employees still can. I think this also partially addresses the sub-contractor issue you brought up. These sub-contractor employees still qualify as potentially better connected than locals (by virtue of their ties to the Coca-Cola mothership), and, by soliciting their participation as individuals, we may still get them :)\r\rWhat do you think of these potential mitigations?

My though is that since a lot of the tools you have mentioned are different digital devices (or even entry at an outpost), what if each entry is assigned an ID, which then create a dot on Google map, like an IP address. In this way, the map can show density of dots in certain area which Raise a Flag.\r- secondly, what would we do with these data, how do we warn and give two ways communication back to the reporter of the incident. More importantly, how can organization's workers distribute warning information and prevent abusive events before it happens. Similar to an earthquake or tornado warning, there maybe lists that people can sign up to receive alerts, or independent radio station with these info.\r- thirdly, training of organization workers. I think Raise a Flag should make sure they are independent and has proper training, since in a lot of hard-hit areas, there are much corruption.\r\rI hope these thoughts trigger some other ideas for you as you continue to shape this concept.

I love the idea of of assigning each entry a unique ID and 'pinning' it to a google map. That would be a very simple way to create a 'heat map' of human rights violations. This would be easy if the submission mode is smartphone, as the app could give the reporter the open to utilize GPS. It would be a bit trickier if the submission mode is phone call (landline) or, especially, text message. I suppose that if the submission mode is phone call, the automated voice greeting could instruct callers to include the location of the incident in their description. For text messages, I suppose the instructions to include location would have to be provided well before the incident, during enrollment or when potential reporters become aware of the Red Flag service. Maybe the outposts can provide potential reporters cards with instructions and tips for making a report if they see something. What do you think?\r\rI hadn't really thought of making the service two-way (i.e., providing updates BACK to reporters). I think the focus of the concept is getting reliable information from the area out, to the rest of the world. Where possible, though, information back to the reporters and the rest of the area is a good idea. To Shannon's point, if there are Red Flag outposts in the troubled area, they could serve as one means by which messages get back. Radio could be one option here (I love Karoline's People's Radio concept: http://www.openideo.com/open/usaid-humanity-united/ideas/people-s-radio/). Runners are another. If reporters have the luxury of a smartphone or internet, its a little bit easier (push notifications). If submission happens by phone, maybe callers can opt in to automatic call-backs or something. This makes me think of an important feature (which is related to both your first and second point). Analytics can play a role in both identifying potential atrocities and in determining the Red Flag organization's subsequent response. For example, maybe if the frequency of reports per square mile per hour exceeds some threshold, the Red Flag organization declares a crisis and increased communication back to reporters or back to the affected area is triggered. Definitely interested in feedback from you or others on this!\r\rYour last point is important. I'm envisioning two components to the organization. There's the centralized org, which would be responsible for overall governance, quality control, coordination, and analysis. Interestingly, I'm not sure if the centralized org's staff need to be located in the same geographic place, or if the organization could be virtual. I'd probably prefer having everyone located in the same place, but what do others think? The second component of the Red Flag organization is the network of outposts. This, to me, is where your point about training and mitigating the risk of corruption is most important. If the staff in an outpost were all non-natives, that might reduce the risk of corruption. However, a staff of outsiders may have less credibility with locals. Maybe a mix makes the most sense??

For phone call and text message, I think about tracking system that 911 utilizes. I think your idea about making instructions available to users are not only necessary but also critical, for example at outpost at a community space which I plan to discuss more below.

A big con might be the fact that, in the more closed countries (the ones that also happen to be where Red Flag could be most valuable), authoritarian governments might prohibit an organization like Red Flag from having a physical presence.
