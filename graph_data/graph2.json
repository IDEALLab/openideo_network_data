We also co-designed and supported a workshop in a secondary school in Delhi in 2009 which used both eBooks and StoryCubes very effectively - http://diffusion.org.uk/?p=1668.\nbookleteer has been created to support eBooks/StoryCubes being created in around 80 different languages, including Hindi, Marathi, Tamil & Bengali.

All these tools have been designed to be simple and cheap to make, using basic technologies and building upon craft skills. As publication formats they also allow for sharing to take place not just digitally but physically too. bookleteer now has a low-cost short run printing service (PPOD) for professionally printed & bound versions of eBooks & StoryCubes - here's a post about a project we did last year using eBooks to record stories about objects in the British Museum's collections from 2 villagers from Papua New Guinea's Reite Coast (free to downloaded from http://diffusion.org.uk); which we have also printed PPOD copies of that anthropologist took back to share with the other villagers last month (July):http://bookleteer.com/blog/2010/06/printed-ethnographic-notebooks/\nThe design schematics for the eBooks are licensed under Creative Commons, whilst the designs of the StoryCube boxes remain our copyright as we currently manufacture and sell packs of the 'blank' StoryCubes as products.

I will build on it and evaluate the rest of initiatives at the end of this week. I agree with the idea that innovation is about \"sense\", but also about facts.
