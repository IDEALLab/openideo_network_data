Knowing this, and using this, helps a lot to have a great tourist experience. About the asking for money for directions, that's indeed a sign of things going wrong. Years ago, in Cuba, I experienced the same thing in Havana. Everybody was holding out their hand for some money. In other places, however, where tourism was less, people just wanted to talk to you to learn, share and practice their English. To me, this indicated also that the problem is on both sides.

Yes, the increasing global population does bring with it more more dangers and challenges.  The world's urban centers are much more populated, and densely populated at that, than ever before.  And with large portions of those urban populations living in substandard housing, many people are left more vulnerable than they should be.  I agree with you that a more efficient system of disaster response will have direct impact on the lives of the victims.  As we saw in Haiti, the survival of people trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings was utterly dependent on how quickly relief workers could be mobilized and get to them.  One thing I like very much about the Ushahidi system that Meena brought to my attention, is the ability of trapped people to text their location and condition to the system.  Rescue workers monitoring the map generated by the texted data can then more efficiently target areas with the most trapped people which would enable them to hopefully save more lives more quickly.Thanks again for your comment!", "user": "7c8e822d3f154bb2b046f6e1085eea54", "date": "December 16, 2010, 01:44PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "how_can_disaster_relief_be_coordinated_to_make_it_most_efficient_and_effective", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Indeed Demian: Ushahidi is used in both those ways.

Ushahidi's use and adaptation to the earthquake situation in Haiti was really great.  I am sure I do not understand completely how it was utilized but I think it would be great if it could be used in both directions. From one perspective, victims could use it to report their medical need, location, an emergency, etc. so that a working map of situational need could be established and monitored.  But also from the other side Ushahidi could be utilized by incoming aid organizations and rescue workers to notify other aid organizations of their contributions and capabilities.  Aid organizations could post the supplies, food, equipment, etc. that they have brought in.  They could also give information on their location, the personnel they have on their team, their mobility, established nodes of distribution, any immediate need in their current location, etc., etc.  All of this information from every aid group could be aggregated to form a continually updating map of relief work being done, current clear lines of transportation, points of distribution, areas of specific need, etc.  This could greatly help inform other aid organizations on what is needed at the moment and how best their available resources could be put to use.I could go on and on... but I love it.

The Brazil model you mention sounds very interesting and a case worth studying.  Unfortunately it seems that automakers in the United States have been focused not on fuel efficiency innovation but on maintaining the status quo and selling a driving experience based on artificially cheap gasoline.  Since gas has been so cheap for the last 30 years, car buyers can indulge in vehicles with more power and size.  In Europe, however, where gas prices have historically been less subsidized than the U.S., vehicles are generally smaller and more efficient.  It could be argued that a more realistic understanding of the actual cost of driving has created a culture of buyers that is more concerned with fuel economy.Maybe the real challenge is to change the culture to not only accept but to also want vehicles with greater fuel efficiency.

So true that the world's oceans are utterly important in so many regards.  And very ill-treated and ill-considered.  And, yes, the laws and treaties you mentioned meant to broadly govern the oceans seem ineffectual at best.  I wonder if one of the main issues to consider in thinking about your question is the method of monitoring.  The ocean areas tend to be so big and the resources available to police them so limited that a lot, evidently, goes on unnoticed.  Or some things at least.  For example we can track the migratory patterns of humpback whales, measure the rate of melting at the polar ice caps and watch from above as hurricanes form.  But we have no idea where the Somali pirates are at any given time or when they will strike valuable freight vessels next.  Or from what land the largest amounts of polluted water and waste material are being dumped into the ocean.Would it be possible to construct an internationally run network of satellites that monitors every single boat on the world's oceans and waterways just as air traffic control systems monitor all flights at all times?  The other big question that I care very much about, as noted in my 'Plastic Bag Problem' concept, is what do we do about the immense amount of trash and pollution already in the water?  The middle of the Pacific ocean is reported to be a swirling galaxy of plastic debris.  And it is only getting worse.  Should a massive clean-up effort be undertaken?  Or can we just leave it and try to do better by polluting less in the future?  Questions, I think, that need to be asked.Anyway, I could go on and on but I am glad you added this concept question to the list.  It is a very important one.

What I think is interesting is that often, when presented with a question or challenge like this, my first inclination is to think about how to raise the standard of living for those at the bottom of the economic pyramid (ie: providing the education, tools and training people need to help themselves).\nHowever, if we all can agree that the presence of such drastic income disparity is troubling and needs fixing, then I think it's equally important to think through how those at the very top of the pyramid can distribute and invest their own wealth and resources to help \"balance things out\". One idea that comes to mind is Warren Buffet and Bill Gates' Giving Pledge (givingpledge.org), where the world's wealthiest have pledged to donate the majority of their fortunes to charity. \nWhile the Giving Pledge is an example of how philanthropy can be a huge part of the solution, I think we also need to consider other, non-financial resources the wealthy have access to  things like education, professional networks, business savvy, etc. How can the people with these types of resources share what they know and what they have with those who dont?

Very well stated!  I think the thing that no one talks about is how massive the sea-change will necessarily have to be as the world shifts it's economic and political momentum based on fossil fuels to that of one geared more and more toward clean renewable energy.  Probably because no one wants to talk about how painful or what a upheaval it will be.  But it has to be done.  And the sooner it happens the better.  We just need a coalition of strong leaders that have the guts to do the right thing to move the world's economy away from oil and coal and toward renewable energy.  Otherwise the massive upheaval will find us when the climate, affected by global warming, changes countries environments and landscapes for the worse.  Or when the world's oil supply is depleted and prices skyrocket, tipping the market scales and crippling economies.  You are correct in that there will be challenges.  But they have to be faced.

I think the key to what both you and Johan are talking about is incentives.  Startup companies need to have incentive to innovate in the green technology space. As you mention, competitions are one way to do this.  Another way would be for governments to make the business climate favorable for the incorporation of new energy solutions with research funding and subsidies.  Unfortunately it seems that the current political and economic climate, in the U.S. at least, favors big oil companies and traditional fossil fuels.Johan's comment about getting people to band together and demand cleaner energy from their leaders and energy suppliers is a good idea too.  But it is also about incentive.  My guess is that most consumers tend to take the path of least resistance.  Using the energy that is already being supplied to their homes is much easier than joining a campaign to demand for cleaner energy sources.  But maybe if they were given enough incentive that might change.  This is one of the keys to the issue I think.  Whether is it pricing of fossil fuels that hurts their wallets more than renewable alternatives, seeing evidence of environmental damage that directly affects their lives, or whatever, there will need to be a trigger that catches consumer's attention, ignites their imagination and fuels their passion to bring about change for the better.

I agree with you, and others, that lots of application is needed in the energy industry.  But I think that there is a motivation problem hindering this process.  The use of oil and other fossil fuels for power continues to be just too 'cheap' for anyone to be motivated to make any application initiatives.  The economics get in the way of real change.  Of course we all know that this is an artificial economic situation made possible by massive government subsidies and tax breaks.So maybe the major innovation that needs to take place is not in the clean energy technology itself but in the legislative process and the influential relationships maintained between politicians and the big oil companies.  The big question to me is how can politicians be convinced, or pushed, to reduce the ridiculously huge amount of  subsidies they give to oil and fossil fuel companies that keep the price of fuel artificially low?  Sure it may keep voters happy in the short term, but this system hinders, as you mention, advances in application of clean energy technology as well as continue us further down the path of polluting our environment.A huge paradigm shift needs to take place in not only how the world thinks about energy and how we use it, but also in how we fund it.

Thanks so much for your warm comments about my post, on your post.  Like you, I believe and see, how inter-related \"we\" are with nature, \"I\" is not \"we\" and \"we\" are part of the much bigger picture of nature.  \nWe blink, everything blinks, each action has a corresponding reaction, good or bad. The false fragmentation has allowed \"us\" to do things we would never do if \"we\" really understood the relationship and how harm to nature is directly related to harm to ourselves.  If floors me how obvious this is, but, at the same time, does not serve the larger perspective of un-linking, in order to remove ourselves, from responsibility and the relationship' we need to live and survive.\nThe grant idea:\nI have been independently and very consciously, taken Obama's Open Government (OGD) Directive, as a concrete vehicle, for thinking through something which can be done now, to actually make a sustainable difference.  (I have tons of experience with grants).\nThe basic premise is taking an already existing, powerful system, federal grants, which operates in an outmoded, counter-productive system.  I want to re-design this system, to be totally congruent. A majority of Congressional allocations, for programs, goes through the grant system (outside of federal contracts).\nThe OGD requires each federal agency to consciously plan for collaboration, citizen participation, transparency and accountability.  Consciously the principle of transparency and data, has been inextricably linked to the use of technology, which make obvious sense.\nThere is an equal push to include citizen participation, collaboration and other sub-sets of the directive, to be addressed through the use of technology.  I do not agree. Technology is not the answer for everything.  The human factor is essential and basic to our human nature.  Not very different from what you are talking about with community, connection and relationships.\nAs a starting point, I do not assume anything.  Success, in my model, is directly linked to capacity building, seemless integration of the primary principles (in the background of the grant design), and an open system for continuous improvement, failure analysis and evaluation. \nWe can take any federal grant program, the focus doesn't matter.  I made one up called \"Read for America\", to illustrate the idea easily.  Starting with the conception of the RFP (request for proposal) development, I would teach grant managers about the directive and make sure the primary principles of collaboration, etc. were written and built into the grant application process.  \nIf the grant focus is: \"all student's in America will read proficiently by age 10\" (there are a lot of reasons why, which I will not go into now), we want applicants to write up what they will do to make that goal come to life. At the same time, they have to clearly explain how they will be transparent, collaborative, encourage citizen participation and accountable throughout.\nMoving through grant conception to the application phase, I would set up temporary sites, in all 50 states, for grant applicants to receive training and technical assistance in federal grants. Our goal is increasing their chances of being successful applicants.  \nNaturally, this training would include all aspects of the OGD.  Currently non-profits and community groups are at a tremendous disadvantage in federal grant applications, almost set up to fail, unless they have the resources to hire specialists, including evaluator's.  Some of this is equally true for philanthropy.\nWe would remedy this by balancing the playing field, offer capacity building workshops, at these sites and online, everyone would have a chance at doing their best, not guessing what the feds want.  \nAs we move through the grant-making process, we would make sure everyone  is educated and informed, while building understanding, capacity, connection, participation and communication.  The OGD in action. Any issues will emerge faster and reliance on each part of the whole becomes ever more apparent.\nEveryone who comes into this system, at any point, is always left off better than before, always.\nApplications are sent in and evaluated against clearly understood expectations.  While not everyone \"wins\" the grant dollars, everyone involved is getting smarter about change, innovation and what the OGD concepts really mean. Already this is a huge step in the entire system.\nOur grant \"winners\" will be connected to a social/grant closed network.  Currently this does not happen, each grantee is on their own, by themselves, with a grant manager who has many grants to monitor.  \nCurrently, South Dakota has no idea what is happening in Washington, or California or Alaska and on and on, unless they attend very expensive meetings once in awhile in DC. \nWe would use technology to connect grantees from the beginning. They would share ideas, problems, solutions, etc.  All grantee's would get to know each other, just as they do on Facebook now.  \nThe OGD in action again, using multiple systems, including state and local systems, for success, saving a ton of money and increasing the likelihood of great results across the country.  This would also build up our best practices catalog, be much more accountable and go beyond current limitations. The potential is limitless, something we can implement within a year, and can begin using a demonstration type of grant process.\nThis is a very basic outline of my idea.  Love any feedback.  Thanks for being so encouraging.\nHappy New Year to You Too!Andrea\n", "user": "e024f9589c1e9d64b34cb1257d9c9dfc", "date": "January 10, 2011, 10:44PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "how_do_we_rekindle_universal_awareness_of_our_interconnection_with_one_another_and_our_shared_natural_environment", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Andrea, thank you for your post.

I agree that sometimes plastic is the most practical, especially for handling raw meat, etc. But the impractical use of plastic is also rampant and widely accepted.

The plastic bag spends less than one minute in actual use.  And then hundreds of years in a landfill.  So terrible.  And both the person buying the soda and the clerk don't think twice about it.Either public opinion about the use of plastic bags has to change or public policy has to change.  The person buying the soda could have refused the plastic bag knowing that it was not needed.  Alternatively, if plastic bags were banned there would be none for the clerk to offer, and therefore none to quickly throw away.  My bet would be that neither the buyer nor the clerk would miss them.  Another option would be to charge for a plastic bag, making the option available for someone with several items to carry but forcing the buyer to think twice about its use.I think that a look back at history might be useful in thinking about alternatives to plastic use.  What did people do to carry things before the invention of plastic bags?  Or plastic in general for that matter?

(And if you mix together different stages of recycled paper fibre, even more times) And the water and energy use for making new paper out of recycled fibres is smaller than making new paper from raw materials. Remaking plastic bags out of recycled plastics are almost exacly same energy-use (as making bags from raw plastic material)Plus : a Paper bag thrown into a forest or side of the road will compost itself!!!So a total profit if you calculate cradle-to-cradle.And of course an even much larger profit if you bring your own textile bags to the shop!", "user": "656863f55543ea22d1dbce290f237277", "date": "November 15, 2010, 04:48PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "get_rid_of_plastic_bags", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "One important point, the amount of saving in making a paper-bags system over a plastic bags system is lost when you add up the extra transport it takes to carry paper bags verses plastic bags that are far more condensed.

However, we have reached such a state that we can eliminate the money, rearrange our social system and grow even faster, as now money has become the most corrupting medium ever. In other words, money was good in the past, but now it is an out-dated mechanism.\r\rWe would not need to revert to an agrarian society, as most of the products (including food) will be produced automatically. There are hydroponics, aeroponics, automated farms and other ways to grow food without much human labor (I presume the amount of human labor would only decrease over time). The same goes for other products - we have 3D printers that can print any object you want for a very low monetary price.\r\rDo not imagine that this kind of a system would be implemented only after destroying everything that has been created in the monetary system - there are many things that can be used. As for the main computer in particular, in the transition period many home computers can be connected into one network to create a super computer. This can be found even today - offices sometimes use one supercomputer instead of PCs in each office, and there are projects like BOINC that use the computers of the participants all over the world. So creating that would not be a problem. As technology evolves, we will be able to eventually use better, faster computer as the core systems and recycle the resources of the products that are no longer in use.\r\rAs for the resources and value, The Venus Project does not offer to substitute something else for money. If it's gold coins, paper bills or firewood branches, it is still money. Instead, there would not be such a mechanism. It is not very hard to imagine how it would function. If you can grow food with hydroponics for yourself and your family at home without any labor involved, the price of these products is virtually zero. You might say that one needs to pay for the materials used, but you can recycle and build it completely for free. Energy? The same, although it requires more work to get it to function completely for free. \r\rWhat I'm trying to say, the monetary value we put on products is not required at all as we can produce everything we need virtually for free and never require people to pay for anything. Many people like to count such things as construction costs into the price of a product, but if you regard it as a one-time investment, then the price drops drastically.\r\rMy explanation is probably vague, so I'll give another example. Imagine that a city builds a giant greenhouse that is designed to generate it's own water (e.g. from the water vapor in the air or underground water), it's own energy (e.g. solar, wind, steam (which also works on the principle of solar power, not coal), geothermal), and produces everything automatically. Volunteers only come to maintain the greenhouse and adjust the systems if needed. Let's imagine that this greenhouse is a gift from the city hall to it's citizens and they do not need to cover the costs of construction. In that way, there is virtually nothing left to pay for, as everything is produced for free. As for transportation - let's say all citizens come to the greenhouse and pick the goods up themselves. But food can also be delivered to the market using an electric vehicle that powers up by the same energy produced by the greenhouse.\r\rYou might notice that there is however price for the construction included, we can't get rid of that as of yet because we live in this system now.\r\rI understand that I covered only a small portion of the questions that arise, and I may have caused new questions to arise. If you wish to delve more into this matter (maybe you want to prove to me that this approach is wrong and faulty, or you wish to see how it isn't, or you just want to find out more about it, etc.), be sure to drop me a note. I will keep an open mind and together we can evaluate all the information we can find.

Quite a concept.  Thanks Kale for your creative energy and passion about this topic.  Unfortunately I don't think I see it in quite the same terms as you or the futurists you site do.  Such a broad range of topics to consider in this concept... but maybe the most important one to address is the issue of money.  'Money' may represent greed, economic disparity, etc. but it is also one of the key innovations that has allowed our society to specialize, develop and grow.  If society was solely based on resources, it seems that we would have to revert to some sort of agrarian / dawn-of-industrialization type of society.  But even then I am not sure how anything could get made without the use of money as a representation or place-holder of value.  The concept mentions the world's  resources being monitored by a computer.  This one aspect of the concept raises lots of questions for me in terms of money alone.  Such as: how does a computer advanced enough to monitor the Earth's resources get produced without the use of money?  There are just too many refined parts as well as research that would have to go into an object such as a computer to produce it with anything other than money.  And speaking of research, I am not sure I understand how design (of computers or anything else), innovation or intellectual property might be valued by a 'post-money' society.  Even though a designer might be contributing an abstract thing such as an idea would they still be paid for it in natural resources?  But then valuation would come into play.  As soon as one idea is deemed worth two pieces of firewood and another idea is thought to be worth three... all of the sudden that firewood, though in one respect nothing more than a natural resource, in another respect represents value.  The firewood has become money.  I am not sure there is a way to be free of money without reverting to a much more primitive society than what we are used to.I will pause there and spare you any more questions.  Interesting stuff Kale.  Even if not very plausible, your concept is very fun to think about.  There may even be some insights into how our society currently functions, as well as critiques of it, within these thought exercises that we can discover and learn valuable lessons from.

It's my own personally belief that the first goal would be, of course, to raise mass awareness of this project.  Once the common folk of all reaches of the planet become aware of this new way of doing things, we can then pressure the leaders of our countries to have an international monetary 'reset' day.\nAll countries (1.) agree that the monetary system is destructive and benefits the lives of the few rather than the whole, (2.) reset all debts of all nations to zero and (3.) create money to be equal value throughout the world.  Once this is accomplished, we could use the monetary system in a way to encourage the growth of a new economy.  Once technology has been focused on by all nations to increase the crop yields, (currently, there are farmers in the United States paid not to grow because their product is in such high abundance, their product would be worthless if it continued to grow as it is) advance technology to slim down the work force (create almost a new kind of welfare, temporarily), and push things like sustainable and updatable technology (so that things don't go to waste) while simultaneously working toward creating abundance.\nAnd eventually the need for credits will just.. vanish.\nNow, of course, that's just my take on it and does not necessarily reflect the vision of Jacque Fresco of The Venus Project or Peter Joseph of The Zeitgeist Movement.

The only way to try a resource based society within our capitalist world would be to make a test city as the Venus Project wants to do, it would have to be able to fully function on its own. But that's where the hitch is, for this city to work properly it needs essentially the best technology available in every single way. The amount of resources required to set up this test city would be immense. This is a project of larger scale than ever has been attempted before, and it requires a whole shift in our ways of thinking like the project is suggesting but this isn't easy to implement. The governments as elected bodies are representing a people, their party which then represents the citizens. Before they can do anything large such as this they need the support behind them, and to change this many people's minds is a huge challenge. \nNow personally I agree that we need to dream big to have big changes and I admire those that are passionate about something and want to see these great changes but personally I tend to work for more realistic targets. I'm looking for the smaller changes, the steps which will help our world immediately. I don't think of our world as a bad place as a whole, I'm a very positive person. I see the good in almost everything, yet I understand that there are a lot of problems which need to be solved which is why I think developments like OpenIdeo are wonderful, they encourage people to start solving these problems and making the world a better place.

And then you phone 5-10 friends and tell them to do the same, just like Multi-Level-Marketing-pyramide-scheme.

They goes around to all electricity producers, and say: listen, we can give you exclusive one-year-contracts with 100.000 homes, if you give us your lowest offer, and you promise to give us cleaner way to generate electricity for us.

If you like that initiative: go and shop there and tell your friends why you support them. IF they do something bloody wrong, stop shopping there, and tell all your friends! use technology to read up on business practices and then spread the shit or salute those that do good.\nIndustries and business must learn to listen to what the crowd wants and prefer, and they will change, they have to change.

I love IDEO, but somebody told me (from their perspective) that the design consulting firm thrives on ambiguity. To be fair, design is a profession where ideas need to be protected and respected, and designers need to earn their income for their skills as an earned living. So design education and design consulting has a price.  So how can design expertise and high quality design education be accessible to us all, right? \nWell, I am going to give this some thought and hopefully, post an inspiration for you soon.  Also, I want to post something constructive for Open IDEO. It will be a post along the lines of accessible design empowerment.  \nI too thought about going to grad schools like Stanford D School or California College of the Arts (CCA). I also came across many expensive workshops I wanted to take from leading innovation experts.  But really, what works for me personally is --- if I really want to move and shake the world and play a leading design role  --- I just go do it.  I see what I want to do, and I design my own way to get there.  \nAlthough it may increase my knowledge and skills as a designer, formal design education is not my only route.  I have invented my own path by serving my community in civic engagement groups, and leading non-profit organizations with workshops.  I learn about communities from interacting.  Personally, not having to pay a cent for formal grad school education, everyday community service enables me as a leader.  Lastly, I just want to end by saying what my feng shui master says, \"the world is a book.\"", "user": "8757541db3a21588d7952dbb8fb5fe29", "date": "November 16, 2010, 05:01AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "interdisciplinary_incubators", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Kristine, I think you are right re elementary education, but what about us now?

We should get the department of education involved.  Begin with introducing small projects to students in elementary and high schools that enable design thinking.  Design education should be accessible in public education very early.\nAlso, I was fortunate to have an undergrad design education from UC Berkeley.  I also contemplated going to Stanford Design school for graduate studies afterwards.    It's an expensive path, and I didn't pursue it. Frankly, I now see that I learn more about innovation from interacting with socially cause-driven groups outside of the traditional education system, such as from my mentor at GEO Feng Shui Education Organization in SF, and my involvement with non-partisan civic engagement groups here in the Bay Area.

I think the problem begins with basic assumption that you identified as the difference between grading people and continuous improvement. Change agents need to focus on making explicit the problem and alternative, I might put it this way: \nOne model of organization views people as the problem and the solutions are control and individual grading and incentives. This creates an organizational culture of mistrust, blame, and fear that undermines collaboration, risk taking and innovation. \nThe alternative organizational design views the problem as the complexity of systems. Since systems create results, it makes no sense to grade and blame individuals entirely. The focus then is on collaboration to assess the system and improve its processes. This requires collective incentives aligned to strategic goals, like serving \"customers.\" \nI'm just finishing an article on this new paradigm of customer focused organization: its strategy and chain reaction of social and economic benefits. The contrast is between a precise definition of bureaucracy and the  total quality organization. There is also a contrast between the shareholder and stakeholder models of firms.

The goal is not just to be sustainable by being carbon neutral or such, it is to actively grow in such a way that more life is enabled through one's growth.

I'm suggesting our current, primarily government and many non-profit agency infrastructure's, are not prepared or designed to support innovation and change, either structurally or professionally. \nIn the public sector, there are rarely incentives and many perceived risks, to step ahead of the curve. At every turn, the 'what's in it for me\" question comes into play organizationally and professionally.  Government agency personnel are skilled at surviving different election cycles and leadership changes, regardless of policy initiatives. \nWe are currently experiencing this play out in the Obama Administration's Open Government Directive (OGD). OGD emphasizes collaboration, participation and transparency, which had led to game changers in technology, not necessarily systemically.  This is a big worry to me.\nInnovation requires a tolerance for failure and risk, many government agencies and non-profits are fearful of failure analysis. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation is perceived as a grading system, not as part of a continuous improvement. Recently, requested government data has been described as \"low hanging fruit\" (Sunlight Foundation).\nMany agencies were caught with their pants down over available data to support transparency.  They simply didn't have the data or much of what was called for, no one had built this capacity into the system and no one really thought it would be asked for so publicly.\nIntegrated into tall of this (and more), is the notion that core innovative concepts are not well understood, or even at all, by many of the people and agencies charged with implementation.  To my knowledge, there has been no capacity training on OGD, no step back to look at organizational change and infrastructure, no \"think-tank\" opportunities to look at current organizational design or capability to integrate core concepts into new norms, which would effect program outcomes.\nThis could be because of job description, as well as fear of losing power, control and influence over the current system. These behaviors are difficult to uncover and even when uncovered, not changed.  Innovation in organizational systems needs confident leaders and champions to support the fundamental culture and values of an innovative organization, definitely in government. Good ideas need to stick and people, and the organizational system, has to be designed, inherently, to support it.\nI know this is a long answer to a smart shorter question.", "user": "e024f9589c1e9d64b34cb1257d9c9dfc", "date": "December 13, 2010, 01:28AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "innovation_in_organizational_design", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Andrea, this is very interesting.

When people are trained that the ideal is to meet others needs before considering their own, they are left with the choice of being \"selfish\" or of having unrecognized needs of their own which cripple their ability to respond to the needs of others. As an example, I offer a classic: Alienated rich youth tries to act compassionately, but has no concept of his or her own need for community connection and habilitation. Youth is unable to care for themselves emotionally, and is clueless bordering on abusive to the people they try to help. The exercise in compassion is less than successful. The youth becomes bitter, blames the people who \"don't want to be helped\"and becomes the next reactionary, unthinking conservative.(as opposed to conservatives who do think, which there are many)If people are encouraged to accept and understand their own real needs, they are much more able to respond to the needs of others in an effective way.", "user": "299453c107788839f427a6169f591ac4", "date": "December 05, 2010, 06:45PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "how_do_we_incorporate_empathy_into_our_everyday_work_thoughts_and_outcomes_", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "What I like is Yehuda Bergs Power of Kabbalah.

Now imagine other avenues where such information could be collected from the voting polling booths to say phone apps that provide personal tracking and tips for increasing happiness while providing anonymous aggregate statistics for policy makers/researchers. Of course, these measurements will be a combination of qualitative and quantitative, directionally meaningful though by no means perfect. However, just recognizing and being aware of wellbeing as the end goal, can have profound impact. As Albert Einstein so eloquently put it, \"Not everything that matters can be counted. Not everything that can be counted matters.", "user": "b15ab3f829f0f897fe507ef548741afb", "date": "December 19, 2010, 03:11PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "how_do_we_broaden_our_focus_from_economic_growth_to_genuine_wellbeing", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "One of the largest challenges for this concept is metrics.

I left high school last year, to get home schooled. I felt, and feel, so strongly about this, and believe I can contribute a lot to this concept.\nSo a little background: I picked up a passion five or more years ago. I found an extreme interest in technology. I started doing web development three or four years ago. Two years ago I found a job working with other high school kids. (I still work with them.) It wasn't a lot of work, but I became encouraged nonetheless. I taught myself everything and continue to learn-- I spent hours a day with this.\nSometime between the time I started doing web design and maybe a year ago, I found a passion in ideas. I began writing ideas-- lots of ideas. I started thinking a lot. I'd have ideas for businesses and projects. I started thinking, and writing, a lot about government and life and people and education.\nI couldn't.. I cannot stand the education system. I couldn't stand the system. I can't stand this system. It was overwhelming. To persuade my mom to let me get home schooled, I wrote (found this on my computer):\n\"I don't want to go to school because it's taken far more from me than it's given me. It's made me angry, upset, and stressed. It's given me a false sense of reality. It's not even about the learning. It's about getting through school, to get to college, to get a job, that will most likely make me miserable. Or, I can live, learn the things that interest me, and do what actually makes me happy.\"\nI was miserable.\nNow, I'm home schooled-- my mom has supported me, but she won't let go of the standardized testing and the intensive core classes and the transcript-- I haven't escaped the path that public school set me off on.\nThough, home schooling does have its advantages. I have found more time to follow my passions.\n--\nWhat I've learned from my experiences:\nCompulsory education is good at what it does-- I am compelled to do my work, but I'm miserable and stressed (though, I'm not sure how effective it actually is-- how much do people retain from this system).\nWhen I start thinking about what I'm learning, all of it seems plenty important: English and Math and Science and History. I take interest in all of these! English is important to communicate effectively. Math to understand the vastness and meagerness of things and to calculate simple things. Science to understand life and our place in existence. History to learn from past mistakes.\nBut as soon as each becomes a subject, they lose their attractiveness and I lose interest. This, I believe, is because, frankly, school sucks! As animals we learn to avoid bad things. School bad. Things in school become negative, and when we experience these negative things elsewhere, they keep their negative connotations-- It always sticks with us.\nAlso, actually how important are these subjects to us? Can we measure this? Can we see what actually does matter to society? What is the actual object of it all-- and why don't we start from an objective, and work to fulfill something clear?\nWe don't need a new system. It would take a lot to convince me a different system could work. Systems break easily. Human determination and passion, on the other hand, is quite stronger. We just need to learn how to take advantage of that.\nI would love to discuss ideas for how this could be solved with anyone who'd be interested.

Obviously I will have more knowledge about how Education as a whole operates over here, then say in Europe and in the States, though I am passionate about finding ways that a) assists learning to the best that we can achieve, whilst b) making the process enjoyable for people of all ages (an important factor because learning is a life long process).\nYour comment has given me a lot to read, digest, and consider. This goal of mine is something I hope to shape and define as my experience in the field of Education grows and when I have seen what works and what doesn't. The hardest parts are a) getting people enthused by the prospect of changing Education for the better (as you say), b) meeting everyone's learning needs and c) dispelling popular myths and conceptions about school in general and what being a learning being means.\nYou are right to address the application of any research we have found, and it seems that the best way would be to first design an Educational model that works and is enjoyable, then gain funding from governmental or philanthropical means to test it, (ie actually create a new form of learning institution) then come up with a way of assessing what students have learnt. After we have evidence that student learning and development has happened, that may sway others.\nA book I have just finished reading by Howard Gardner mentions just that. In his book 'The Unschooled Mind' he describes how his Project Spectrum combined the school style system with a museum and apprenticeship model of learning. I have no idea of the effects of such a model in the long term, and he does indeed mention complications such as students copying work and struggling with independence, however the benefits seem to out way those factors. Students are able to learn from other students of all ages while being involved in concrete projects that are guided by the teacher, as the students act as apprentices. The projects are then discussed, critiqued, shared and displayed at the end of the alloted time. One of the ideas behind it is that it involves students seeing the purpose of the things that they are learning and the benefits it offers to society. For more info on Gardner, see the website (http://www.howardgardner.com/) and for information on Project Spectrum (http://pzweb.harvard.edu/research/Spectrum.htm). I'm sorry I cannot talk more on Gardners work as I have only recently come across it, and know very little about him. However such approaches and new designs for how school operates will lead to fruitful results.\nI had never considered addressing each area in turn, ie literacy and reading, then go with the best ones. I had immediately considered revamping the WHOLE structure and model of a school, because it seems that the problems resulting from Education are not necessarily like patching or fixing certain parts, it seems that the problems are in the DNA of school, to use a genetic analogy. I could be wrong, perhaps your suggestion may work. As a race it seems we have infinite time to try both, and more ways to make Education better. If we can get people involved and concerned than more people will address the issues and help. As you say getting the wider community involved would be great, especially if we could get people to see Education in the same way that Environmental concerns have been addressed, as Sir Ken says, then so much for the better.\nInnovative ideas getting 'stuck in the system' wouldn't surprise me because for the large majority of people they feel that it's best to stick with what we know and not waste time on changing things. A common complaint i've heard from people in Education is that when they are getting to grips with the way teaching practice works, then those in power come along and change it. I can see the frustration in being told that the rules I have to obide by in my job are constantly changing and becoming increasingly demanding. I do not see why Education needs to be this way, it seems we just have to eliminate the weeds growing in Education so that our students and people can grow. Schools need to become less like a military department and more like workshop or a fun fair. In the sense that the division between 'school' and 'life' does not exist, everything is connected and related to each other, and that students want to learn and be praised for their efforts, and teachers want to see that happen. At this stage raising awareness seems to be the first step. If we can get people to become involved with Education in the way that the recycling and environmental movements happened, I have no reason to doubt that the same thing cannot generate solutions and interest in Education.\nPhew!", "user": "2f7b129d53cb485c68c94919ddfafb15", "date": "December 15, 2010, 06:01PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "reforming_the_education_system_to_encourage_enjoyment_and_innovative_thinking", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi James,\nThere is no doubt addressing our education systems, world-wide, is a fundamental game changer.  We have a tremendous amount of research and thinking about how we can make it happen and raise the bar to excellence (maybe not enough).\nI am stuck on how we can take the research we have and apply it and develop an environment which encourages thinking and action along these lines. What if we created a series of demonstration projects, using innovative ideas and testing them out. What if we did this collaboratively with governments and philanthropy, so policy could evolve?\nI've been playing around with re-designing the federal grant making system, to build a capacity building model, integrating best practices each step of the way, regardless of sector, field of discipline or focus area. \nAs part of a much bigger idea for organizational change, I created a \"fake\" federal initiative called \"read for america\".  Why?  Risk and resiliency research tells us a lot of things, one being that if kids can't read, by at least 10 years old, they are likely to start disengaging from the social contract.  It's one of many known risk factor we can address.  \nWhat if we created initiatives and grant programs which targeted that one variable, as a start (it could be another)?  We would surface the best ideas, fund the ones with the most promise, and evaluate every step of the way. \nWe could target the entire system, making sure the implementer's had the professional and organizational capacity and support needed.  Other community stakeholder's would be built into the entire picture. Technology and social media would play a big role in connecting these initiatives, creating a community of grantees, learning and solving problems together. This does not happen very often at the moment.\nThe RFP process would be creative and grounded, involve introducing the ideas and knowledge we have, or need to have, about innovative education strategies.  Imagine the energy and excitement created to encourage your challenge?  \nI am not an educator, however, I have worked with educational systems throughout my career.  I know innovative ideas can get stuck in the system, if the system doesn't adopt them.

I think this important not just because it's a way of mobilizing government staff to make more effective contributions towards poverty reduction efforts, but its also demonstrates the motivational power of education. Unfortunately, more often than not grass roots development workers are in workplace environments that are far from motivational. They are often poorly paid and receive little recognition for doing good work or coping with the difficulties of working in remote rural areas. In addition despite multi-million dollar investments by international donors, they often have very small budgets to work with and are \"not trusted\" to manage these budgets. It's often a very hard job, but simply by listening to these people and providing some simple incentives (such as professional recognition though an education program) can have a significant impact on their effectiveness. Professor Yunus (noble prize winner) says that \"we must not leave the problem of poverty to the next generation\". I agree. We have the technologies, the resources and the collective will power to change this terrible shame of the modern world. The fist place to start is to mobilize and make better what already exists. I believe we can quickly make a significant impact on global poverty if we spend less time looking for the \"silver bullet\" of the new \"technology\" that will solve all our problems, and focus more on making better use of what we already have. There are many thousands of community development workers already in a position to make Professor Yunus's dream come true. Some critical motivation and support can easily be provided to these people using existing resources and structures if we are prepared to rethink the way we approach education.

Many of those social businesses ARE better and more efficient than governments in developing countries. However, the fact remains that these governments already have systems in place that are not being utilized to their fullest extent. Should they just be done away with? What a shame to discount a source of great potential just because it is currently inefficient. The reality is that these systems will be around for a long time, whether they become effective or not.\nFor example, in southern Laos alone there are 5000 government agricultural extension officers at the district level. These guys are working the closest to the poor. They are government workers who have a high school education, average age of 40 years, and they have been charged by the government to bring agricultural technology and services to the poorest of the poor. They are the front-line. These guys are not going to go away no matter how many social businesses are doing their job better. \nI am a huge proponent of private sector development and the power of the right business model to create change. But I posted this design challenge about governments for a good reason. Billions of dollars have been spent and will continue to be spent on government capacity building (much of this government-to-government). The point I am making is this: Can we not harness the creativity and innovation currently being applied to social entrepreneurship and ALSO apply it to how we think about working with governments?\nAgain, check out the PRAM project in Laos. We need more examples of this IN ADDITION to more social business solutions.\nhttp://pramlaos.wordpress.com/about-poverty-reduction-and-agricultural-management-pram/", "user": "94f8ef29957040e42b74843c902d2eea", "date": "November 28, 2010, 06:50AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "are_governments_being_overlooked_in_development_work", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "David, interesting and important question. In my opinion, see also my concept on social enterprises, governments are best equipped to create the circumstances in which individuals can make a change. I think the many social businesses that are coming up in the world are the most sustainable way to bring in change. Maybe even better and more efficient than governments and aid organisations can ever be. I think the biggest challenge for governments is not a lack of capacity, or too much influence of corruption, but more a matter of power struggle. For dictatorial regimes, benign or not, that seems obvious, but in democratic countries policy is often made and executed with the results of the next election in mind. And I think there is a growing disconnect between what political parties in that system think the people want, and what people really want.

But that is not the point.\nI think we need more creative thought and innovative ideas in how aid organization's can better understand the needs of these governments and build their capacity at the same time as helping the citizens within the country. You may be familiar with IDEO's Human Centered Design Toolkit. This is an awesome resource for any organization wishing to design solutions according to the real needs of a community.

I give you an example.  Every year 4 million babies are born in the US and not one of them comes with a hat!   The cost of making a knitting hat by machine is very similar to that of making it by hand in the developing world.   It's small and takes little time to make by hand, whereas its a little tricky and time-consuming by machine.   So why don't we make all knitted baby hats by hand and create employment.    A much bigger example of this in action is in the sweater industry in Bangladesh.   The whole industry still use the hand operated 'handloom' knitting machines, where every line of knitting is made by a man (usually) pushing a carriage across the work.   I was astonished when I first saw it that all this hadn't been replaced by snazzy computer operated machines.  In fact the cost of investment in this machines did not make economic sense when considering the cost of labour in Bangladesh and so the old method remained and the industry creates work for millions.", "user": "e3cf33cebe2e6c3e1f8d52015a33936b", "date": "November 14, 2010, 05:09AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "reduce_poverty_by_creating_employment", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Imagine, one inspired lady getting 5000 women a fair and basic income, whilst working on all those different communities, spread all over the country.

Very interesting idea to use rolling budgets to separate the grasp for money from the grasp for power.  It seems that money has trumped the just, moral or human right as the prime decision-maker in policy and legislation.  But even with rolling budgets I wonder if it only stretches the current situation rather than change it.  For example a U.S. senator of a certain political party is still going to push for funding for projects that funnel money to people within their state.  The more people that are kept in jobs and happy, the more likely they are to vote for that senator again or for someone else within their political party.  Even if those jobs are for questionable practices such as heavily subsidized, environmentally damaging, unregulated drilling on protected land for fossil fuels (hypothetically speaking).  Regardless of when a budget is voted on it still remains a game of self (or political party) preservation fueled by money.  So to me the question is can a political system be designed so that the policy makers will have incentive to vote for the just, noble or right thing instead of the popular thing?

I agree that democracy is a faulty system.  Politicians make promises to get elected and then, once in office, make decisions based only on what popularity polls predict will get them or their party the most votes at the next election.  And it is a universal problem, not just one party.  You mentioned McCain.  Well, if I remember correctly,, Obama pledged (is that the same as a promise?) to close Guantanamo prison.  As far as I know it is still operating two years after he took office.  I think this is a tough problem.  But one, as you mentioned, that should be discussed.  Maybe there is a way to hold politicians accountable for pre-election promises.

Of course no chain grocery store would support this, but maybe a whole food would or something.

Even an art exhibit or something would be really fascinating. \nArjan, good points, though I would argue that food aid and cheap subsidized imports do more to harm to developing countries' agriculture base than a growth of local farming would cause in the US / Europe. Wonder what the economic impact would be on local economies if there were less imports going INTO Africa. \nSO much of this is about education. It's a hidden problem in a lot of ways.

My point is that these cities are sustained by vast complex supply systems, particularly food, water and power systems. As such, I think the discussions would have to include elements of the supply and waste processing chains that enable cities to exist in first place.

I wonder what other ways that could be done?Most people I know don't know how to cook well. I'm a big fan of time and energy efficient cooking.\n\"thermal cooking\" , where the food is heated on a stove to boiling then placed in an insulated container to continue cooking for several hours and stay hot for hours more, has great potential for making easy inexpensive, healthy food portable. Portable thermal cookers are all over Asia, relatively available in most of the rest of the world, but strangely are not readily available in the U.S. except among the DIY crowd on the Web.The last time they were at all popular here was during the \"Great Depression\" of the 1930s. Social groups and churches held training meetings to teach women how to make and use the cookers. This is ancient technology that reduces energy used in cooking by 50-80%, and makes a family meal portable if desired.They are becoming quite popular in some parts of Africa as well because of the reduction in fuel gathering necessary for cooking.Thermal cooking is great for beans, grains and stews,(anything cooked in a closed pot) and thus fits well in most traditional cooking worldwide.\nFast food eaten by the poor is picked up on the way to or home from work at whatever cheap place is on the way. If households lack adequate affordable public transportation, then choices are limited to walking distance Whether they are taking the bus or using a carpool type arrangement, simply getting to a real grocery store, where you have to stop, go in and look for what you need can be a challenge to add to the time budget. Many areas have no grocery store within walking or easy bus distance. All the food available is fast food or convenience store bottom of the barrel (not very good). \nThe idea of teaching that many people to cook after being trained out of it for almost 2 generations now is pretty daunting, but I agree it is completely necessary. Urban gardening has more potential to feed people well than trying to get real grocery stores into places where they won't immediately prosper.\n\n\n", "user": "299453c107788839f427a6169f591ac4", "date": "December 21, 2010, 04:30AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "how_can_the_growth_of_the_obesity_epidemic_be_stopped", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Sabra, thanks for the thoughts!  I totally understand your point about less privileged people not having the time, energy (or money) to work out or afford a gym membership, etc.  But I think that the idea that making healthy meals at home takes a lot longer than picking up fast food is a myth.  Yes, availability in poor neighborhoods of good, healthy food can be an issue.  But the time it takes to prepare it does not have to be an issue at all.  I think with a little education and the right mindset and everyone can make cheap but healthy food at home in very little time.  Jamie Oliver's 'Food Revolution' series and his OpenIDEO challenge http://openideo.com/open/how-might-we-give-children-the-knowledge-to-eat-better/brief.html were very much focused on this.Maybe one of the actual hindrances to this is that our culture has largely forgotten how to cook.  Since it seems as though all adults in a family usually have to work to pay the bills, very rarely is there a person that stays home and prepares meals.  So the importance of this skill has been put aside because of work economics.  And today people solve this problem by buying more pre-prepared foods, whether from the grocery store or fast food.  This practice tends to skew calorie intake and fat intake. higher because of portion size and ingredients used.Your charity idea is interesting for it's educational aspect.

I agree with you in that price perception is a major factor.  My guess, though, is that government subsidies for big agro-business have helped to skew pricing and keep certain things artificially low while at the same time leaving other products to suffer normal market forces.

Jamie Oliver has been doing some great work in this space.  But much more is needed!  What strikes me is that I think this is a modern problem.  The mechanization and industrialization of food brought on by post World War Two manufacturing advances have caused our culture to quickly collectively forget the food traditions that our grandparents and their parents passed down.  If we look to absolutely any culture just 100 years ago we might see that they were all just as (if not more) price sensitive as we are.  Yet they were able to eat both cheaply and relatively healthfully.  I'm sure it was also helpful that everything they ate was not super-refined and super-processed.

Or if it was illegal to subsidies growing sugar and was put a tax on it in the restaurants, that should go to the expensive health care that needs to take care of the obese individuals.-----What I have learned about fast food is that the ingredients is combined so cleverly by the restaurant chains that it is containing the perfect contents of it, and in perfect amounts to make you addicted to it.Yes! Sugar is in extreme dose in the soda.Carbohydrates is packed in the fries/chips.and Protein and transfats in the meat.There can be 44 teaspoons of sugar in one regular serving of soda!!!The artificial sweeteners have strange effects on peoples organs, and can be the sole reason to diabetic diseases!\nYes! sugar is addictive! it is medically examined and proven!\nThe amounts of sugar that kids consume these days is hitting the physical and emotional central nervous system and makes them happy, exhilarated and doped up. It will make them crave more! yes, the hormones in kids makes them crazy.It is already commonly known as sugar rush!it is the biggest reason to concentrational issues in school and with falling results of their education as the biggest result. The reason to \"new disorders\" like ADHD, ADD, dyslexia, obesity is right under parents nose. And they keep stuffing their own kids full of the drugs.\nAnd still people would b relatively free to eat whatever they feel like. Some of them already know the side-effects, but many keep on, like heroin-junkies, they drink soda in huge-mega-gulp-containers. and they cannot stop.\nThis is dangerous vicious negative spiral. And in worst case scenario it is what makes difference between healthy people (getting good jobs and good salaries) and unhealthy people (unemployed, poor, not being able to buy and eat healthy food)This obesity problem used to be a problem only in U.S.A, but as the notion of living the american dream is spreading to all continents, I guess it is only matter of months or weeks before this problem arises in Chinese cities too.-----Technology must be put to use to educate people, educational system must bring in the parents to show difference in how their children performs on a standard test before and after a fast-food-diet/sugar rush.Political systems must be changed to inflict massive attitude and behavioral change for many people.

You are right that some people can easily handle mastery of both systems.  I have worked with both in the field of design and fabrication and it is manageable.  Though I will admit that I think metric is the much smarter system.  Conversion between units and scaling up or down is a piece of cake.  There are just so many problems inherent in the U.S. Customary system. For example, doubling 6 5/8\" can either be 13 1/4\" or 1' - 1 1/4\".  And this assumes everyone understands the \" and ' marks.  Another example would be that 'one and a half pounds' should really not be written as 1.5lbs but rather 1lb 8oz.  The reason being that not all of the decimal divided pound measures are as easily convertible to ounces.  1.6lbs for instance.  Then there's also the confusion between ounces of weight and ounces of volume, remembering how many tablespoons are in a cup, etc.  But, you are correct in that some people get along fine with it all.  I think the big problems, as was mentioned, come into play when conversion error happens in commercial industry or when lives are at stake such as accidentally overloading a plane or using fractions of an inch to build a spaceship.  And on that last point I have to endorse the metric system - fabricating something down to the millimeter is much more exact and straightforward than when fabricating using sixteenths or thirty-seconds of an inch.Anyway, i think the main point is that if we were all using the same system of measure that things would be that much more efficient.  A unified system would save time, precious energy and money, not to mention possibly a life or two every once in a while.  The metric system, adopted by almost everyone - except the U.S. and two other countries - seems to be the most viable candidate.

There are a couple of big questions and challenges surfacing.Even if the data is available, it is not often in any useful form. Agencies themselves were never set up to collect or organize much of the requested information, and even when there is data towards transparency, how to make it relevant and useful is 'the big question\".  It's the \"so what\" part of the bigger question?  Who is going to use it and how do we make it useful to real communities and citizens?  This was a major focus at a conference I spoke at, hosted by the National Institute on State Politics and Money, this past June.  This meeting was invitation only and was primarily a mix of investigative journalists and those in the transparency \"movement\" and/or Gov 2.0. I was invited because of my applied experience in communities.\nDavid is quite accurate in his comments that the open data movement is empowering the already empowered.  They have hopes and ambitions to involve local communities, but don't know how.  \"So what or who cares\" if you have the data and nobody uses it?  This is a struggle going on now.\nThe Sunlight Foundation (http://sunlightfoundation.com) is very involved with transparency and data.  They are not the only newer non-profit with their eye on this ball.  How effective they will be in translating all this, in a way it's useful to local communities, is a good question.  Another group working on this, in a more applied way, is Code for America (http://Code for America.com).  It's modeled after Teach for America.\nI get somewhat concerned when so many doing this data work are great at technology, but don't have experience in community or applied setting work, or any of the other parts of the whole picture.  This may be where the breakdown is, or will occur, even if great data is available. I am very in favor of multi-disciplinary teams, involving various professionals and age groups is important.
