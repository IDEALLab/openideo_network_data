On-line there are plenty of ideas suggested here. I think the best way is a simple form to the like of the Singapore project people can fill either from their PC or mobile phone. \r\rI think it would be usefull for the form to include the question \"Has something triggered this memory?\" it would help identify issues, aspirations people have and would help design initiative to respond to them.\rAlso reading the stories on the Singapore initiative it may give more dynamic to the story reading process to first get people telling a story to add to the headline a 2-3 sentenses summary. Stories tend to be fairly long by web standards. In our world especially on-line we loose people's attention fairly rapidly if we don't hook them up in the first 2-3 sec.\r\rTo be inclusive of all ages it's also important to have an off-line process to capture stories. There the Singapore initiative could be a great partner as they have planned to train story teller etc.. \rMaybe an additional tool could be to let such forms in places where people go often, food markets, post office.

I thought your concept would work well with 3 others, below is my idea:\r\rAfter reviewing James Robertson's \"Flash Sports\", Eugene Tay's \"Community Recycling Center\", Hao Dinh's \"Dish In Dish Out\" and Maria Malcus \"Local Night Markets\", I had the below thought on connecting the 4 concepts:\r\rHave \"flash night markets\" (these are night markets that are scheduled to occur in specific communities during specific times) that will enable vendors, both from the community  and from other night markets, to sell their goods.  Great opportunity for community vendors to highlight their goods to their communities and allows vendors from other night markets entry to \"new\" customers.\r\rThe entry fee to the \"flash night market\" is a potluck dish.  Each \"flash night markets\" will have a theme associated with a community issue.  Once in the market, participants will be able to meet new people, try all the potluck dishes, buy items from the vendors and most importantly, contribute to organized discussions on how to resolve the community issue.  \r\rLastly I was thinking of having an \"community recycling center\" at the \"flash night markets\".  The center will educate people on reuse, recycle and reduce.  Additionally people will receive \"market cash\" for bringing in their recyclables.  The \"market cash\" can be used to buy products from the \"flash night market\".

With each apartment acting as a pixel (or 4, 6 or 9 pixels as the movement grows in complexity). Residents could then decide on what kind of image they want to project, and how many colours to use. Once an image and colours are decided upon, a few clever people work out which flat needs to display which colour(s), and then inform the residents. Assuming not everybody has every colour, there would probably be a lot of lending and borrowing of sheets and bedclothes. These could be hung from balconies (as a temporary alternative to flags - for but but a fleeting moment lest we lose any nation pride), to form an image like this:\r\rhttp://www.brooklynartproject.com/photo/my-president-is-pixelated?context=user\r\rAlternatively, simpler pixelations could be created just using national flags.

I guess it would be naive to think that the kind of reward the volunteers would gain could match a proper salary, and perhaps if the scheme grew too much in could be in danger of depressing wages across the industry, so I think there would have to be entry criteria, such that it really was aimed at helping out those who need the biggest leg-up to get onto the career ladder - perhaps the young and those out of work for 6+ months.\r\rIn terms of prototyping, your idea about establishing a home for the library as the very first building to be refurbished - sounds fantastic, and I love the expansion into furniture and signage, even touching on design, fantastic!\r\rKeep in touch with any implementation thoughts.. will try and get the ball rolling in some capacity here in Singapore soon!

Imagine two glass panes, and in-between different shapes that can be moved with a magnet. This way people can create al sorts of sketches, and because of the transparency they might interact with the projected environment spontaneously. To add more freedom it's also possible to draw on the board and on top of the shapes.\rI made a quick sketch to clarify my thoughts, check the other image above.\r\rAnother thing that pops up in my mind is what would happen if we'd place a tracing board in front of a (slightly tilted) mirror.

I am intrigued by the amount of thought you put into using security levels to build trust within the community.\r\rIn terms of target marketing, for drivers, I was thinking you might want to target young professionals. As far as I know, many young professionals in Singapore service car loan close to 10 years, just to earn a status symbol of owning a car at a young age. They however, find ways and means to save on monthly fuel costs and car maintenance. And the good news is that young Singaporeans are also opening up to the concept of CouchSurfing.com and Airbnb.\rAs for the riders, i see the ridesharing platform as an alternative for the riders whom are facing a taxi crunch in Singapore. And that's also why I love this idea, because it helps to ease 3 problems with one solution. 1)alternative market for commuters not able to get a taxi during peak hours 2)lesser pollution, greener environment. 3)encouraging greater community engagement\r\rI echo Johan's thoughts on distributing a written guidelines as a 'code of conduct' for both the drivers and passengers. I was born and raised in Singapore, and thought one essential element when building the community is for both drivers and passengers to be sensitive towards each others religion and culture.

I would suggest pitching the same concept with sports like 5-aside football and basketball to a big apparel giant like Nike/Reebok/Puma etc. Teams of friends enter a series of pre-arranged and marketed events; when the enter, they must register their profiles into the FlashSports Ap (open to other suggestions on names... 'GoPlay'..?...Nike Play - sounds similar to Nike +, could be an easy modification. I have little idea what the economics of such an event are, but I would imagine the lower the barrier to entry the better - not thinking of these $100 races where everybody goes home with a bag full of toiletries etc.. perhaps a lightweight bib/vest?\r\rAnother way (initially offline, and free to enter) might be to have an Ice-Cream van approach (not sure this will be well understood in Singapore!) but this could involve an elusive and exciting van that turns up without warning (but with great fanfare) in neighborhoods all over singapore at various times to create pop-up tournaments/matches.. it brings temporary goalposts, scorecards and bibs etc.. kids (and adults) can make teams and play for free but they register their details first. Then they can then download the app. If pro sportsmen and role models for the young could turn up to support these events then even better!\r\rThe Singapore Sports Council would have to be really engaged and incentivised from the outset for this project to work. This shouldn't be a tough sell, as although the bigger aim is gain more usage of free public space, they can still gain an increase in usage of their chargeable venues like gyms and swimming pools (and associated f+b outlets) under the same app umbrella. Integrating payment/booking of chargeable facilities would be a step for a little further down the line I guess.\r\rThe area we still really need to understand remains the local champions.. what kind of a person would be evangelicise this service..? how old are they, what is their full time job..is this a full time liason job for some people or do we focus on the users and word of mouth.

I think sport and the arts would have to be branded and marketed differently in the end.\r\rSo, looking at the icanbook facility, it seems to have a lot of the essential functionality i'd hope for in the booking stages, but I think the Flash Sports app would have to allow for a whole new level of spontaneity, and encourage the use of free parks especially; the focus would be more on connection; connecting individuals, teams and sports, and the booking facility would be a seemless easy 1 or 2 click action.

Great opportunity for community vendors to highlight their goods to their communities and allows vendors from other night markets entry to \"new\" customers.\r\rThe entry fee to the \"flash night market\" is a potluck dish.  Each \"flash night markets\" will have a theme associated with a community issue.  Once in the market, participants will be able to meet new people, try all the potluck dishes, buy items from the vendors and most importantly, contribute to organized discussions on how to resolve the community issue.  \r\rLastly I was thinking of having an \"community recycling center\" at the \"flash night markets\".

Great opportunity for community vendors to highlight their goods to their communities and allows vendors from other night markets entry to \"new\" customers.\r\rThe entry fee to the \"flash night market\" is a potluck dish.  Each \"flash night markets\" will have a theme associated with a community issue.  Once in the market, participants will be able to meet new people, try all the potluck dishes, buy items from the vendors and most importantly, contribute to organized discussions on how to resolve the community issue.  \r\rLastly I was thinking of having an \"community recycling center\" at the \"flash night markets\".  The center will educate people on reuse, recycle and reduce.  Additionally people will receive \"market cash\" for bringing in their recyclables.  The \"market cash\" can be used to buy products from the \"flash night market\".

I love this.\r\rA challenge I see is getting people to do it in the first place. It's a little like hitchhiking. People can be hesitant and just not bother since it's easy to be lazy and not do it (i.e. just drive yourself to work instead). Not everyone of course, but many. Lindsey mentioned an honor system. That's a great way to ease this worry. In fact, I'm thinking the exact same system that CouchSurfing uses could be implemented. Drivers could build up some positive reputation.\r\rSo...\r\r1) As a driver/rider you would create a profile online, and other users vouch for you by rating/reviewing you. At first these would likely be friends, but then users could review you once you start doing some commutes with them (either as a driver or passenger). An actual picture of yourself on your profile clearly helps ease worries.\r\r2) Other drivers/riders see this and know you're a good person (obviously, the more reviews the better). RideNow could verify users by having them make a $1 donation online if they want an added measure of security, which helps identify it's really them (the name on the card). Their real name would not be shared through this action. A real name as a username would obviously help though, like the picture. I can see people using an alias name online, and then sharing their real names when actually driving/riding with someone. Easy enough for the new connection to ask for their alias and review them using that.\r\r3) CouchSurfing sends a postcard to the address the host claims they live (where the guest would be sleeping in this case), and the host then inserts the unique code on the postcard into a verification system - ensuring they do in fact live there. I'm thinking this could be transferred to license plates instead of addresses. This would verify the driver is in fact driving the car they say they are. Alternatively, a driver could post a picture of the car they drive. Riders could then view this on their phone (of course there's an app!) as the driver pulls up.\r\rAgain, this is basically how www.couchsurfing.com does their optional verification. \r\rI think it could transfer over well.", "user": "a8a845e64668893557aced9b5db82e15", "date": "October 28, 2012, 05:25AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "commuting_as_connection_point", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Great example on aligning incentives, Lindsey.

The outcome is published in a book compiled on the spot and then available on the website (http://www.whatdesigncando.nl/archive/downloads/WDCD12_book_web_yellow.pdf).

We have 1000's of non-profits here in the Boston area (there are over one million in the U.S.), but getting related organizations to collaborate on shared goals--say to increase cancer-screening rates, or enhance parental involvement in kids education--is uncommon.\r\rThere is a terrific sample of ideas here that communities could apply related to improve their environments.  If each community had well-trained \"civic stewardship teams\" who had skills in help local people generate, adapt, and implement ideas such as these, they would be much more likely to succeed. And if these neighborhood teams were collaborating with peers in other neighborhoods--and by working together, could compel institutions to engage--initiatives in any community would be much more likely to succeed.\r\rBut, by nature, this idea is a bit abstract--it's about helping people organize; it's not about a concrete solution to a specific problem--such as a community garden to provide healthy food, or a creative way to call attention to urban design opportunities.

Peer pressure is what made micro finance successful in India.\rOne other thing, entertainment-edutainment-edugaming is the key to the success of our solution, the more engaging and fun is the workshop the better.

What kind of gift do the people that achieve the goal of reaching the end of the workshop successfully could receive that could help even more reinforce the goal of our challenge?

Really good questions, especially about the laws.

I used street art as an example, but the same idea applies to community gardens, or citywide mural arts programs.  I think when people are allowed to have complete control over even a small element of their surroundings they begin to develop a personal connection and sense of ownership over the space.  That sense of ownership makes people want to maintain their environment, because now it's \"their\" space.  Ideally, the community works improve their city because of a sense of civic pride rather than fear of harsh punishment.  \r\rI'd be super excited to collaborate in the next segment to develop some ideas together!

Basically the mural painting would take place during a local artisan and food fair, featuring the products of community members. In San Francisco, the Mission District hosts it's \"Party of Block 18\", which is just this. People in San Francisco come together to enjoy art, music, food and bond as a community. It is a great way to learn about things going on in your area and develop a sense of community pride. Here is the link to the event I attended this past summer: http://sf.funcheap.com/party-block-18-mission-dist/. \r\rAs far as the mural painting itself, I came an organization based in Brooklyn that might serve as a good model. Artmakers Inc., run by local artists and a board of directors, is according to their website: \"politically-oriented community mural organization that creates high quality public art relevant to the lives, work and concerns of people in their neighborhoods\". They provide advice and guidance to community groups wanting to create murals, giving their time to groups that \rlack funding, providing on-site visits, design workshops, and production advice.

It's a wonderful avenue for people to unwind in the evenings, get something to eat, and interact with each other on the weekend or even on the weekday after work (after nightfall). A wide variety of food is sold along with goods--and the vendors and traditional food sold sometimes vary depending on what night market you attend. \r\rWhat if skill/knowledge sharing was integrated into some variation of a night market concept and institutionalized in the same way?--for instance, night markets would exist in which people would set up kiosks (neighborhood mentors or neighborhood gurus vs. helpers) and people could come to learn a new skill or arts and crafts or discuss a particular topic--along with chowing down on some local grub. \r\rTo help launch the process, people could use some sort of online community portal to vote for what skills they want to learn or what topics they want to learn about, then local mentors/gurus could be identified and matched and rotate time volunteering at the market (if sponsorship could be obtained, mentors/gurus could be given some sort of gift or bonus for sharing their services/knowledge)...and the skill/knowledge areas could vary by market as the concept got bigger!\r\rSorry so long, but you got me going.
