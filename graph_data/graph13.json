The survey takes about 15 minutes to complete but provides the user with an immediate diagnosis of their current 'physical' age, potential risks and how they might reduce them.  There are gadgets to allow the user to make immediate changes so, for example, a smoker could see the immediate impact of giving up, or the potential changes of taking more exercise etc.  \r\rWhen run in the UK under the campaign 'Are You As Young As You Feel?' we had an extraordinary response from our people, and it went viral.  Using the results to discuss with a doctor or health professional (such as a nutritionalist) provides a powerful and very cost effective way of:\r\r1. Gaining health data about your people\r2.

The idea of having something that's random and spontaneous can seem bizarre.

Employees should always feel comfortable in what they are doing. It could be a flash-mob where people are in their own comfort zone. So for example, it could be a design meeting sitting down in an office or studio, where the employees are brainstorming ideas by writing down one word then immediately getting up and sticking it up on the wall, until it is completely full of words. This is spontaneous, different, fun and collaborative. So they are participating in a flash-mob while they are working. \r\rYes, a lot of busy work lives may not be able to adapt this, but it could simply be 5 minutes where the employee is not constantly working but doing something different, which could still be working but in a more spontaneous, fun manor, as described above. \r\rAppreciate your comments.

And if I may add to the subject you opened, yes is about styles of management, but mostly on the roots of the symptom which is about how we design organizational systems, which is the foundation on how effectively a company works, and how this effectiveness affects us. Let me explain. If we take a deeper look on companies or institutions, and apply Systems Thinking, what we have is that they all are organizational systems which elements of construction are three: People, Technology and Resources.\rIf we take a side the most valuable element, which is people, and we could imagine the system working without us, we could see that a healthy system, an effective one, is that which has its processes running effectively using technology and resources. The more flowing the processes are, the most effective and healthy the system is. Ray Kroc, the creator of the concept of McDonald's as we know it and it's first CEO, saw this. What he saw is that he needed to build an organizational system people proof, but not in the negative way, in the positive one, he saw the quality of the product needed a standard of procedures to ensure the client he will get the same kind of hamburger in Main or at Orlando. He saw people as we are, the asset that can transform or update that system using our creativity and our minds.\rWe do not have to forget that we, as part of an organizational system, we go to fulfill a function, we go to execute tasks. With us, without us or despite us, the system requires that that function must be performed. As you correctly put it, the system requires certain results from each and every position existing in the company or institution. And that's why we should be measured by results and not by how many hours we spent at work looking busy.\rOrganizational Systems, companies or institutions are built by us, and if we understand that we should design them better, from the foundation, we are looking towards a healthier life, because we would need to understand us better, on how we better perform and would design them thinking on us and the world around us. So then, as you say, our style of management would change, because the systems we work at would be more effective and would need a more effective style of management.", "user": "a11c7d024a0a7a22809b6e4be3c4c523", "date": "November 16, 2012, 02:23PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "work_family_social_overhauling_our_ways_of_working", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Isaac, thanks for commenting.

At first maybe limit to members but then expand to include people who don't belong to the gym; as a bonus they may attract more members in the long run.\r\rSlightly removing it from the immediate office environment might be a bonus too; standing in a towel next to my co-workers waiting for unisex showers was an interesting experience, but perhaps a little anonymity in amongst a larger hub would be more comfortable!", "user": "7e7dcb823cb8bac78bee007e8041492e", "date": "January 06, 2013, 03:24AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["tweak_daily_routines_"], "comment_count": 7, "title": "Bike Commuter's Hub", "evaluations": null, "type": "concept", "id": "bike_commuter_s_hub", "applause": 11}, "see_the_value._try_the_value.": {"description": "What are employers without employees?

A couple of ideas to contribute to your concept: Building up from a comment by Christine Fam, companies spend a lot of money on employees' health insurance. A great way to measure the success of this program, would be to keep track of the health insurance expenditure over time, after the implementation of the program, and compare it with historical records. On another hand, if a program like this is implemented, there might be an opportunity to create a business. My idea is the following: Healthy food shops could 'pop up all over the place' offering its healthy foods to employees of companies in a certain area, through an online marketplace. Employees can login to this website, create a profile, and order any item (fruits, vegetables, etc.) and pay with their credit card. Profiles would have stats and be ranked in a company scoreboard (nutritional value purchased per month, point system, badges, etc.). Companies can set a monthly goal. If an employee reaches it, the company rewards the employee and covers all of the expenses + a small bonus, just like you suggested, and the proceeds can go to charity.", "user": "fbf5d9326270ca5aaa28e4998d19eebf", "date": "January 18, 2013, 03:13AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "employers_provide_incentives_for_eating_a_more_balanced_diet", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Eating correctly is hard for everyone.

Salary and bonus is objective, but all sorts of other measures, like do you approve of your CEO, are entirely subjective.. I'd be interested to hear which data sets people would be more interested in comparing. Maybe it's worth creating a quick Survey to get an idea. Survey Monkey perhaps. \r\rWould also be fantastic to get an insight into how people are prepared to enter their data - or have it entered anonymously on their behalf. The company health days you mention are one potentially very successful way of doing it; surely it's a perfect environment for Bupa to be marketing their policie, offering a free check-up at the same time. I'm sure they already have mobile health units - buses etc for doing this. Perhaps blood donation collectors could offer a similar service/data collection.\r\rYour point on location is a great one too... it would be fascinating to compare the relative health of people in the same job working in different cities, or even different offices within the same city. \r\rLastly, the elephant in the room that I keep coming back to, is that if you follow the basic incentivisation of this idea, i.e. that companies will be judged against each other on how healthy their staff are, then eventually companies might discriminate against unhealthy employees or applicants. \r\rIn the light of this, perhaps the prototype phase should focus more on the things a company does to allow an employee the chance to look after their own health, rather than focusing too much on their state of health.\r\rWill try to get a survey online in the next day or 2, please make any suggestions you like!", "user": "7e7dcb823cb8bac78bee007e8041492e", "date": "January 23, 2013, 06:11AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "glass_door_for_health_and_fitness_rating", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "An afterthought... technical detail..

Like you said, the email can ask or refer them to glassdoor, and then the employee can decide if they would like to add their information (anonymously) to the site. \rThe barrier to entry it easy for the employee, since the information from the health fair is already filled out for them - all they need to do is consent to glassdoor using this info, and create a new account. Once the account is created, the employee might be even more inclined to anser questions about other health incentives offered by company ( gym's onsite, metro passes, etc.), and the company's work environment itself.\r\rFocus more on a company's health incentive offerings:\rYour point about focusing more on a company's health incentives for this prototype may be the right way to go.

Great scenario's; I can imagine that companies who already do big efforts to increase health will be eager to start this off. Others will jump aboard to show they are working on it as well.\r\rWith this kind of data available, and knowing that health issues costs the society a tremendous amount of money (cardiovascular disease, heart disease, cancer, mental illness) the government could give benefits or lower taxes for companies that reach a certain threshold.\rIf a government or state would say; we'll lower income tax with 1% for companies with a health&fitness rating above 85%, I bet a lot of companies would start measuring and improving health right away.\r\rOne small side note, let's be cautious that we don't stimulate discrimination, as hiring \"unhealthy\" employees would lower the company's score. The data is anonymous, but obesity is hard to hide. So maybe we should not just look at the current health score, but pay more attention to how employees improve during their career.

For the last month I was able to evaluate the WorkFit from Ergotron that provides a standup/sit down option in one unit. Before that, I was using my own homemade standup desk. I also looked into the treadmill option.\rI don't think it's possible for people to stand for an entire 8-9 hour work day and still be fully productive.

I also sat a lot when I sprained my ankle this Christmas.\r\rBehavior: \rOne thing I noticed in an engineering environment is that almost everyone has a laptop and are on the go a lot. This makes portability options viable. I've also noticed some people would go and hide at an empty desk to avoid disruptions and get some work done.\r\rSuggestion:\rI suggest creating a bank of treadmill desks (3-5 units depending upon space) that would be open for anyone. They could be scheduled like a conference room or just open. It would provide the walking benefit for limited periods of times and be more cost effective as it could be used for all employees instead of just those that have one at their desk. If it catches on, more walking desks could be added later.\r\rConclusion:\rThe treadmill desk is a great idea and I believe these types of work stations are the future for progressive companies.

Looks like a good way to help employees balance work and life - while still at work!\r\rI agree it would be a good idea to have experiments on existing treadmills to find out what is most important to workers.  \rA few things I think would be good to test would be:\r1.

Or, do they want the ability to retrofit an older treadmill? \r2.1 Retro fitting another treadmill might be a cheaper option for the worker/company, especially if they already have a workout room at their office.\r3. How much does noise have an impact on the work space? If the set up is in a big open area does this have a huge impact on sound, and does that matter?\r\rLast thing that probably needs to be considered is the wear and tear on the treadmills.

Here is a paper from The Salk Institute. van Praag, H.; Christie, B. R.; Sejnowski, T. J.; Gage, F. H.; Running Enhances Neurogenesis, Learning, and Long-Term Potentiation in Mice, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 96 (23), 13427-13431, 1999\r\rIt studies a group of white mice who exercise on a treadmill/ \"hamster wheel\" contraption....no disrespect to the mice but it was clearly the hamsters design.  (perhaps a refinement of mechanical design to be considered). \rTo paraphrase in my own voice, one group of mice was strapped to the \"hamster wheel\" and  after a period of exercise repeatedly performed a challenge maze where they needed to locate a camouflaged platform submerged under murky water.  (they hate to swim and the platform allowed them to stop swimming).  The other couch potato mice could not find the platform unless it was coated with pudding and rainbow sprinkles....sort of.....you get the picture. Sprinkles aside, exercised mouse remembered location and performed better than couch potato mouse.\r\rI am also aware that the correlated effects can be quick and fairly dramatic and \"may\" even be utilized for things such as cramming  densely packed mission details into operations personnel.  Did someone say \"military application\"  or \"national security interest?\" \r\rOne other thing,  We spoke bout using the treadmill as a platform for part of a  sensor array feeding information on relevant user stats like heart rate time on machine, calories burned etc for correlation with some memory/learning performance routine...like maybe the user repeats a  string of mixed digits and letters that pops up at intervals as the user does their other work. Haven't really thought about that item much.

You could try to get a license of the source code for the SRI product and develop mobile apps on smart phones (design treadmill to smartphone blue tooth interface...easy)  turning them into into node collectors and like Siri, it would report and learn the behaviors of the users....\"all users\" and put the correlation together to discover optimal time...calories burned etc. to achieve optimum results with exercise as a means to memory/ learning enhancement. It would take a code development effort integrating  the SRI source code for the mobile app and probably a \"healthy\" license fee to SRI....who knows OpenIDEO or IDEO relationships with SRI might pave the way for a test case deployment for free or priced based upon some projected revenues....  or they might decide to agree to wait for  future equity in the venture.\r\rEither way....(and I apologize if it has already been said by someone)...but, \"I love this idea on several levels....I'd run with it....\"", "user": "1aceb825510d57af8de055f9ba25b03c", "date": "January 17, 2013, 09:00PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "treadmill_desks", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Eric for sharing these really great insights. \rI agree that the sensor side of things would provide great metrics to track and monitor, but if it becomes too difficult to implement technically, an easier solution would be to just use targets that sports equipments already use (granted, they should be comparable between one another).", "user": "e42683996625a90919063543481b8f3b", "date": "January 20, 2013, 07:18PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "treadmill_desks", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Re: \"too difficult technically\"...do you men expensive?

Great concept. I recall seeing a commercial, I think it was by Verizon, where a gentleman was delivering a speech from tredmill/moving-walkway style podium. I'm not attempting to extinguish the flame of your idea. But trying to build on it based on what I didn't see in that shot. His audience wasn't active. Curiously, all of them were seated. My suggestion... I think you should go Wii Fit!\r\rThe Nintendo Wii (with fit) transformed the living room into a family workout room.  I never thought I would see the day where my family and I would engage (as a group) in physical activity in front of the television. Your concept has the ability to do that for the workplace. \r\rThink StarTrek. Think Gattaca. Offices can transform individual workstations or create ROOMS with \"Active Work\" and Relaxization/Rejuvenation equipment. These rooms could include tredmills (like the mockup above), stationary bikes and eliptical machines with complete work stations.\r\rLots of the concepts for this challenge only focus on the being active part of wellness. What about the mental and emotional aspects of wellness too. There could be a corner of the room with a sound dome pictured here: http://www.powerview.com/20InchSoundDome.html The dome could play relaxing music. It can be an area where workers meditated or praticed tai chi - a gentle way to fight stress. You could add a projector and have video with calming images to ehnance the mood or an instructor to ehnance the experience.\r\rIn addition there is an opportunity to leverage experimental/emerging technologies to address other aspects of wellness like channeling focus. For example, there is an exhibit at the museum of science and industry - Chicago. It challenges to individuals to \"out relax\" each other. http://www.msichicago.org/whats-here/exhibits/you/the-exhibit/your-vitality/mindball/ This would be a fun and creative addition to the \"Active Work & Rejuvenation\" space.\r\rOk I've said a lot. But I won't leave without a suggestion on how to bring this idea together in a neatly packaged concept. If I were tasked with pacakaging this Idea, I'd find/hire an tradeshow booth designer to render concepts of this futeristic space. I've worked with many designers that do an amazing job of blowing out concepts like this.\r\rGood luck in the refinement stage Sarah.

Employees could then move themselves around given how they feel that day or the extent of activity they want to perform. There could also be areas more conducive to meetings, with a bit more space and compatibility for this purpose.

New space may potentially come at a later date to support the need for greater capacity or new requirements. In my experience, getting people together for the sake of health and wellness is often less about the structure and more about its shared purpose. The quality of the training content, shared learning experiences that generate a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction, and the passion of competent teachers/trainers play an integral role in the success of a health and wellness dojo.", "user": "a08e840c9cf4ed4467499c034deb7006", "date": "January 07, 2013, 05:45PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_health_and_wellness_dojo_a_vital_component_of_healthy_workplaces_and_communities", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Glad to hear it helped.

They are placed in groups of 10 to 12, based on age, body mass index (BMI) and residence, and work with a health coach who tracks their progress and lends extra support.  \r\rDuffy says teaming up people who live in the same location is important, because it gives them the opportunity to meet. Ultimately, the goal is to create a sense of community, where people are motivated by their peers. \r\rThis successful program seems to support the team approach, but I think the addition of the health coach is a good one that seems to be coming up a lot.\r\r(http://www.forbes.com/sites/zinamoukheiber/2012/12/11/if-this-diabetes-prevention-program-were-a-drug-it-could-be-a-blockbuster/)\r____________________________________\rSecond, a story on NPR about the tension between health apps / workplace health initiatives and privacy. Just a red flag, and important to address in this concept.\r\rhttp://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/12/26/167970303/who-could-be-watching-you-watching-your-figure-your-boss\r____________________________________________________\rFinally, I came across an existing concept that looks lot like Fun & Healthy Gains. Its called Keas (http://keas.com). I cant tell much from the website, however from the description below it looks like there could be a lot of learning here.\r\rEmployers like Reed Elsevier, the publishing company, are using a Web-based game service from a company called Keas that encourages workers to stay healthy by grouping themselves into teams of six and collecting points for achieving mental and physical fitness goals. Among the challenges Keas assigns: laughing randomly for 30 seconds. The members of winning teams at Reed each get $200 gift cards.\r\rhttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/technology/all-the-worlds-a-game-and-business-is-a-player.html\r\rLots of food for thought, and some exciting areas for innovation.", "user": "429732f96d4ac39303008ee641100eba", "date": "January 02, 2013, 07:17PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "fun_healthy_gains_2013_a_game_of_healthy_competition", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I like this concept, I like the idea of meeting your goals and participating in Fun and healthy gains game, the encouragment focuses on moral and healthy behaviors, which wants me to participate in your games, great idea.", "user": "81614cc924db198dbc0dce69858436f6", "date": "December 13, 2012, 12:56PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "fun_healthy_gains_2013_a_game_of_healthy_competition", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Gurdeep.

As a context, I work in a 10 story building, with approx 2,500 employees in the building at any one time. There are 12 lifts, and 4 poorly positioned stairwells that function as fire escapes rather than 'real' travel routes between floors.\r\rThere is a gigantic 10 story atrium which could easily accommodate a well designed stairwell, encouraging people to use the lifts less and be healthier. The problem is in the fundamental design of the building (which is brand new). How do we present a compelling business case for a stairwell? Through a health-linked initiative like this!\r\rWith that in mind, I approached our facilities team to see if we could use our existing infrastructure of staff ID-Pass readers which are positioned at the entry and exit of every stairwell door. It'd be simple enough to read the access data of each 'swipe' of an employees ID pass, along with the time and location, and plot against a leaderboard of floors climbed per day/week similar to the City Peaks challenge already mentioned.\r\rIn reality, my initial test/prototype raised a number of issues that we'd need to address in our own business; and which you may also need to address in any roll out of a scheme on the tube or in similar office environments;\r\rFirstly the issues with data protection; people always get a bit concerned when they think they're being tracked around the building. Next up was access to this data. While we generate data on who swipes thier ID where and when, the data isn't owned by our firm. I've been told we'd need to contract (and pay) the third party software provider to get access to the SQL server where this data sits. Then there were liceing issues around this, snowballing in to issues around testing, business continuity and compliance. A headache.\r\rNot impossible, but not as easy a win as I initially thought. Still, I think this has the power to fundamentally change the way people move around buildings and fundamentally the design of a lot of new office buildings.\r\rBest of luck in the considerations for the finals!", "user": "eb9a3b6f19db6333bc67264b5e66f054", "date": "February 07, 2013, 11:59AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "lively_london_step_by_step_", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Great stuff Robert  and fascinating issues you've raised here.

REI does not provide \"well days\" nor does REI sponsor outings specifically for its employees. We do sponsor employee community service projects, but they are voluntary and unpaid days off. \r\rREI usually attracts a great group of employees and employees are always planning trips for staff, but again they are not officially sponsored and are unpaid unless you choose to use vacation time. And in an industry such as retail where pay tends to be lower for many folks it is hard to justify unpaid play days in the budget. \r\rREI does award 2-3 people per store per year a \"gear award\" to help you acquire the needed gear for a proposed trip or human powered activity that is new to you, which is great. So, I think that is a great add on to your \"wellness days\" concept. In addition, each employee gets a budget or can earn \"active cash\" to help support a well day or a new healthy active habit. For example $100 reward to buy a ski lift ticket, membership to a yoga studio, or snorkeling gear. What ever fits the bill to help accomplish the \"wellness day.\" \r\rI also like wellness days in addition to sick days because in general I believe that most employers simply just do not offer enough time off options. Sometimes when you start a new job you get only 1-2 weeks off for the whole year including sick days.

The more I've let the QR idea float around in my head, the more I see there are some circumstances where it makes sense and some where it doesn't. For example, I'd much rather just swipe my badge at each floor than stop to get a QR read. The recent suggestions on automatic picture recognition or GPS tracking/tagging fit into this.\r\r- Instantaneous Feedback -\rWhen I accomplish something, even something small, I want to feel that \"rush\". I need to be told right away I've scored points, added to some total, got a new check on the checklist, etc.\r\r- Automatic Goals -\rOne of the most addictive part of many online role-playing games is the fact that there's always something (a new level, better gear, etc.) just slightly out of reach. The system provides these. Yes, I can go off and do my own thing, but there's always a progression path being laid out for me to follow so I'm not ever left with nothing to seek after. It also provides minor wins on the way to accomplishing the bigger goals.\r\rThe following don't hurt:\r\r- Competition -\rSeriously, we all like to win.\r\r- Physical/Virtual Rewards -\rI'd rather not admit the amount of time I've spent trying to gather badges or accomplishments in games over the years. You haven't really \"beat\" the game until you have all of the badges.\r\r- Recognition -\rI used to work in the awards and recognition industry. It's important to note that for many people, the recognition of those around them is far more important in the actual physical award. Actually, the physical award is only really a tool to get more recognition.\r\rThere's a lot of different ideas being proposed, and each is touching on at least one of these areas.

This moves away from your idea of gamifying exercise, but eating right is important when you do physical activity. \rEach person gets assigned somebody to whom they deliver a healthy meal secretly and if the system works, somebody delivers you a meal too! The assigned people get shuffled so you never have the same person in a row. This is a concept more fit for students and would require more active participation. We were focusing on students as our target audience, but I'm sure this idea can be furthur adapted to fit a workplace environment.\r\rI hope this helps develop your idea!", "user": "e0e536533282f83fc55f185d9d320925", "date": "January 21, 2013, 07:36AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "gamify", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "the person wearing the pedometer would be incentivised to compell their team mates to also walk the stairs, even though they do not count their steps, because of solidarity, and to keep them company. its a fun way to start the work day to talk with your coworkers on the way to the office", "user": "656863f55543ea22d1dbce290f237277", "date": "January 24, 2013, 09:54PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "gamify", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "I love food, and I love the idea of a food Secret Santa.

This is a great way to discover other areas to monitor to measure productivity.\r\rTaking the findings from companies that already have PE, develop a program for companies that are thinking about starting a PE program and get some measurements at a \"pre-PE\" state so you have something against which to measure.

These companies would be great candidates to help design and test an app so that when it rolls out to the public most of the major kinks or issues will be identified and ironed out.\r\rIf the app can in any way monetize the benefits from PE, that would be awesome.

May be this will help you modify the description of the solution better.\r\r1. Bonus and applaud for employees, but no direct benefit. Bonus would be unexpected.\r2. Advertisement in local newspaper by company taking up this scheme.\r3. Asking employees to find out if they want to help anyone or spend time with anyone in the locality.4. Put this as a small ad in the main company advertisements as CSR activity.\r5. Open a facebook page regarding this.6. Asking previous/present interns in the company to find out and advertise about it in their own locality.\r7. spread the message to old-age homes\r8. past employees who may be old and they may be interested to find people, help them or get help themselves.9. adding activities to the sessions, so everyone can establish some common ground.10. encourage employees to communicate between themselves to find similarities in the interests of those they are trying to help. \r11. reach out to older folks via the community blackboards which are are common in many low-income neighborhoods across the country\r12. as a cricket-maniac nation, many of our professors love to take part in the annual cricket match we organize in the department on the occasion of Teachers day. After passing out, alumni come back to take part in the match.13. There are many small initiatives like that in every village that can be captured as a spreading point. \r14. Partnering with a micro-volunteering platform like Sparked ( http://www.sparked.com/ ) that already has the connections with organizations looking for volunteers could save lots of time on marketing / finding clients, and can provide a reason for the visit.\r15. getting the older generation involved is a lack of familiarity with technology. Maybe this is one of the things visitors could help with. \r16. help my father to blog \r17. a system where visitee is encouraged to teach the visitor a skill or a recipe. It would be engaging for both people involved, encourage repeat visits over long periods of time and will possibly even give the visitee a sense of fulfillment. \r18. elderly folks could include a wish list of activities they would like to fulfill on a given week. Your idea has led to me to ask ... what if employees ALSO included a wish list of things they would love to learn?\r19. Could one source of that fear be that vulnerable people are opening up their homes to people they do not know?\r20. I would love to see employers give employees some training on working with seniors, as part of this program. Not only would it make participants more effective, but employees may soon be dealing with aging relatives themselves.\r21. In different forms, this kind of community will probably be found in all countries. Women usually are busy in the household chores, particularly in village ares. It will be a nice break for them. After pregnancy many of them don't take necessary precautions owing to superstitions and alike. It will be an interesting point to teach as they look up to educated people.\r22. As both the employee, and elderly individual, would know or have an  idea of what to expect during the visit, the awkward or nervous feeling of meeting a stranger for the first time could be significantly reduced or gone.\r23. Check out http://fixperts.org - I absolutely love their model of short, low cost instant outcome projects done for free, for the community. Could those principles be merged into your concept, and an office environment?\r24. Furthermore maybe look into organizing a staff rotor or a set time a lunchtime for the employees to carry out their visits, instead of at the end of the day when their less drained. Good concept!\r25. In the same way, may be we can play once a week, a game of their choice.

I have a couple thoughts on the areas you're still refining.  \r\rI think limiting the number of spaces makes some sense, but more to manage growth.  At first it will also create a level of prestige that will make people excited to be a part of it.  But I think you want the program to mature into something that feels very open.  I would think of it the way facebook grew.  When it first started we were very excited we could be a part of it when it was only a few schools.  But we were always more excited as it expanded and we could add friends at other schools.  And as it grew in users, facebook also grew in scope. It used that limited access to create prestige but now feels almost universal.  The program could work in the same way so that it has high level success at each stage.  If you do limit the access, I would promote it as managed growth rather than that you are trying to let only the best use it, because I think that message could discourage people.  \r\rI hadn't noticed much focus on pregnant mothers before, but I think that's a great addition.  It is a big adjustment for families.  Even Duchess Catherine has needed to reduce her schedule of activities So if it has that big an impact in the most ideal of situations, I would think there are those at the other end of the spectrum who would really benefit from help with a quick errand.

I think it has potential to be a standalone business following a combination of the Groupon and Priceline models.\r\rThe company, SecretGym, has a different price point each day, such as ten dollar tuesday, five dollar fridays, six dollar saturdays and so on. When you sign up for a day, you pay before you find out what the session is - all you know know is that the experience will be at least 50% off the normal price for that activity (and you can see the historical activities at each price point). You find out as soon as you pay so that you know where to meet and what kind of clothes to wear. \r\rThe money paid is split between SecretGym and the activity provider. For example, one day might be climbing. A regular day pass, rentals and a lesson at a climbing gym would normally cost $36, but through SecretGym it costs $15 - $7.50 goes to SecretGym and $7.50 goes to the climbing gym. After the session, the climbing gym might decide to offer to credit the $15 towards a membership, potentially converting a number of first time climbers to become regular members. It is win-win-win: the participants get to experience a lot of new physical activities that they otherwise wouldn't get around to experiencing at discounted prices, SecretGym has a high margin business from connecting participants with new experiences, and the activity providers get a small amount of new revenue while potentially getting several new long term members.\r\rEmployers could sponsor a weekly mystery activity.

What is more, you could also present this information in a rather unconventional way-- saying, for instance, \"Today you consumed 600 less calories than your previous average.

If your entire neighborhood [refer to user's zip code here] did this, you could light up 'x' amount of houses for a day\", or something of the sort (something that creates more of a narrative that the user can immediately relate to, as opposed to just saying \"Today you consumed 1400 calories\").

I think smaller groups of 5 would work best because most recipe sites are for families between 4-6, so that seems ideal considering servings and budget.

Congrats! Your visuals are awesome. But the idea still booms through nice and loud.\r\rAs a prototype, how about you simply start by tracking blood sugar levels? I am just thinking that bombarding people with all their vital signs at once could be a bit of an overload, and even a scare for some of the hypochondriacs out there.\r\rMonitoring blood sugar levels also provides a great foundation for distributing preventative healthcare and medical advice; when blood sugar is in danger of dropping too low, users receive a warning to top up with some slow-release calories. Diabetics are already using this technology, but I have been thinking for a while that if this combination  of data collection and nutritional information is accurate enough, you could have on your hands a world-beating weight control device.\r\rScenario: A user sees his blood sugar level cruise up nicely into the safe zone as he heads into work after a healthy spinach omlette for breakfast. He is getting peckish at around 11, and wonders how a selection of different snack options might affect him; he sees that if he were to grab a chocolate bar, he'd pick up very quickly, feel great until 1145, then drop off steadily before becoming ravenous before lunch, at which point he'd probably overestimate his lunch needs. He also see that If he chooses a handful of mixed nuts though, he's likely to see his energy rise more slowly, but maintain itself steadily through to 1pm without suffering a crash from the sugar spike. \r\rAllowing the user to make informed choices about diet would be incredible; great idea!

In the US, Interstate highways generally have a number of rest stops for trucks and cars. These rest stops are owned and run by the respective states. Since they are state-owned facilities, the states can try out any ideas they wish. This provides a unique opportunity and environment for exploring wellness concepts addressing the needs of people who spend much time on the road. Typical state-owned rest stops do not currently offer meals, but only vending machines containing snack and junk food. The Healthy Trucker Alliance should lobby the states to take action to offer healthy meals at rest stops. For example, the states could explore the concept of allowing entrepreneur food vendors to operate food trucks at the rest stop locations. Such food trucks are common in many US cities and are the US version of street food vendors found in many of the world's cities. The Healthy Trucker Alliance could urge the states to pass legislation to permit such food trucks to operate at rest stops, but only on the condition that their meal offerings were healthful. Some sort of review and certification process would be needed to ensure that the vendors' offerings promoted good health. The environment of the state-run rest stop facilities provides a unique opportunity for the entrepreneurial community to experiment with healthy food offerings, find out what will sell, and to take risks that the big chain take-out restaurants are too conservative to take. The rest stop provides a steady stream of prospective customers from the outset, giving the entrepreneurs a good chance of succeeding. If this concept succeeds, then it could exert market pressures on the commercial fast food chains to evolve their food  offerings in a healthier direction.", "user": "bfaf4a08807f6d809742c18900a65a07", "date": "December 30, 2012, 08:08PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "healthy_trucker_alliance_spreads_the_word_connects_drivers", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I've added a sample campaign ad (as image and attached document) relating to healthy food options on the road.

One universal \"language\" is sports, and I think that something like the \"Highway Hoops\" concept has a lot of potential for connecting and drawing truckers into the healthy truckers movement. My sense is that \"let's shoot some hoops\" would connect better than \"let's talk about why salads and cottage cheese are better than burgers and fries\", at least initially. I also think that a promising way for connecting to the trucker audience and delivering a healthy lifestyle message is through international ethnic food. I realize that one shouldn't make sweeping generalizations. But my guess is that a significant proportion of US truckers have a background of service in the military, and have spent time overseas, perhaps acquiring a taste for diverse cuisines. (I've sat at sushi bars many times and heard customers talking to the sushi chef about their experiences in Japan while in the military.) So I have a hunch that an effort to promote positive eating behavior changes could leverage the possibility that many truckers may be very open to foods from around the world. Chain restaurants that serve US truck stops may be overly conservative and may underestimate how open truckers may be to eating diverse cuisines from foreign lands.

A calendar, where co-workers can enter what the meal plan is for each day\r2.

I like how it has individual's partciptation and involvement aspect in it and diversity and flexibility. Those are important components for sustainability. By your definition, what is a \"platform\"?\r\rI also think it is important to add the employer and the insurance company into the equation somehow. Not only because this challenge is sponsored by an insurance provider, but because it is sponsored by an insurance provider, which makes it more interesting. Maybe I am reading too much into it, but it is obvious to me that the interest of an insurance company would be 1)build a relationship with their clients, so they are continually employed. 2)less payout to their policy, that's how they can be finanically sound. So if they are not in the loop, first, it is a good resource that didnt get utilized, secondly, and this is same as to the employer, if it is not tie to some kind of budget that is reflected in some kind of parameter, it will often get lost and the initative disappear.(big corperation tends to do that)\rThere are many ways to get them in the loop, hiring a chef is one, but I can see that people might want other choices, like cooking themselves and bring food etc, so having options is good. That lead me thought of other ways instead of always paying for the chef, perhaps an initial investment that's by the employer and or insurance company or even the federation to create that space to eat together in the first place can be an option, I won't be surprise to find that, a lot of the company actually don't have a 'proper' place to do that, or the existing space is anti social somehow.\rPerhaps the comittement level can continue or expand upon their level of success, perhaps it could be a 10 year plan, and eventually a kitchen will be built, if that don't already have it, or even there will be money to build a gym. Then it really blends into the idea of diminishing the boundary of working or just being, creating an environment that not only allow the employee to benefit at lunch time, but throughout the whole time of employment. \rThe \"eat well together\" could be just a kick starter to start a long term initiative to promote better work life, a \"work well together\" initative. In which, each aspect of work is looked at and refined, so that everybody has the optimal working condition and psychological health due to the fact that they enjoy their work.
