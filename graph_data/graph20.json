(an idea - a summer event day that 'challenges' communities - instead of sports, they have 'problem solving' activities/active ways of helping people and a festive nature - free food and drinks would always go down well too!)\r- Listening to what needs to be heard, and giving people an opportunity to contribute personally - as everyone is a designer/problem solver at heart, they just don't know it!\r- Pulling the people together - and almost 'sorting' them into groups of similar interests/aspirations/abilities. The direction that each group goes/outcome that they achieve could be completely different - the common outcome being, achieving greatness!\r- Connecting the right kind of people together - i.e. young active people (who have lot's of spare time/need keeping out of trouble and guidance), with elderly wise members of the community (who need physical support and assistance) - i.e. buddying - this may be wishful thinking, but would be a great opportunity to balance out our communities by 'filling in the gaps' with other peoples willingness and strengths.\r- And finally; Using our voices. Without computers, mobiles, and the long list of other digital devices out there now, we just have ourselves - that's how we started out in this world, and that is often the most powerful way to reach people.\r\rA bit of a long rambly response, but thanks for that Arjan as has got me thinking about it more now!", "user": "84eca4152c766b6a99f6a6c900b89735", "date": "August 01, 2011, 07:53AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "people", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Welcome to the club, Tanya :).

Which is perhaps a very big contribution: you have to be committed and provide the time and energy to produce a great serious game. And the group you're working with must also want to get involved. \r\rWe have the benefit of a global team of more than 400 trained facilitators, and more than 30 donated their time to this event. So, another contribution: ask for help. Chances are you'll need it. And chances are you'll get it. \r\rA key part of the Innovation Games process is making sure the organization playing the games is committed to taking action against the results. In this case, the Mayor's office was committed to incorporating the results of the games into the budget. Avoid doing games \"just for fun\". Serious games are... serious. They are designed to solve a problem (not teach a concept or purely entertain). \r\rArjan, these are some highlights. I've posted extensively about the San Jose Budget games.

Indeed, it is key and part of this is to show knowledge in the field you are publishing. More deeply, it is about building upon others' ideas and develop them (or disagree with them but proposing an alternative explanation theory). \r\rYet, some studies have shown that citing can also be a sterile game: e.g. to be published in a journal, you \"have to\" cite a certain number of authors. I recently read a study showing how academics publishing in top journals basically cite a certain number of authors who have all published in the same journals, or with them... and this makes the possibility for others to publish very difficult. My point here is to say that while it's great to build upon others' ideas, yet I am not sure if it should not become a motivation per se as there is a risk of leading to a multiplication of references for the sake of increasing their design quotient or any other visibility feature.\r\rI understand though the fear of letting an inspiration out and at the beginning, I was hesitating posting thinking that maybe others have already posted something similar, but then I assumed that I just have to jump in the water and that people will be forgiving, and maybe happy to see that someone else with a different perspective had a similar idea. \r\rSorry for this long comment which like some others below is more about how to support collaborative processes on the forum rather than increasing social impact.

I think the most viable concepts should be made famous, not the winners. What, in my humble opinion, has made OpenIDEO so successful so far, is the fact that contributors take part because they want to see an issue solved. Or flex their brain. Or collaborate with some awesome people. Most of the people here are not in it for personal gain. Whether that is a monetary reward, of public recognition and a shot to fame. My biggest fear would be that this type of reward will make the challenges more about winning it, than finding great solutions for the problem at hand. I'm afraid that the promise of becoming famous makes people collaborate less, or at least less collaborative.\rTo be completely honest, the fame part is of course compelling and nice. I was so lucky to be quoted or mentioned in some of the presentations that the OpenIDEO people have done around the world. Apparently there was one at the LIONs in Cannes. Being mentioned in these presentations contributes to my reputation. I got some great feedback on it. And I am very grateful for this. But being mentioned in this way (not as a winner of something, but as one example of how people participate here) made me love the OpenIDEO team and platform even more.

But you can measure the impact of specific interventions by recording micro-narratives of the individuals being impacted and having them self-signify those narratives along chosen dimensions.  You can then see how those dimensions change over time.\r\rI'm doing my best to paraphrase the work of Dave Snowden and other complex adaptive scientists.

I think it can be very interesting to explore this further, and I also think that being able to measure impact will bring about even better change. The biggest challenge is defining the right metrics. There are some that can be general, like how did it add to the Gross National Happiness index (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_happiness), but on a per project basis, you can also define more precise metrics that determine the project's success. How many girls went to school because of a project, how many infant deaths prevented, how much increase in average income in a certain region. Obviously, this depends on the project and it's aim. I think in the Grameen challenge we went a bit in the right direction, when we asked for data during the inspiration phase. It's important to express the problem you're trying to take on in numbers. For example: 20 infant deaths per thousand births yearly, of which 10 are preventable by providing better access to preventive healtchare. Then you can state as project goal to bring it down to 10 infant deaths per 1000, and you can actually measure that. (Sorry for the morbid example, but I think it is an important one to take on).\r\rI think for true measurement, we need to define metrics both on the macro as on the micro indicator scales. And then find a way to translate the micro ones into the macro ones to define an organisations' overall impact. Maybe on the macro level, we could base it on the hierarcy of needs.

Although \"crowd sourcing\" is a new term to me the technique has been used for many years in various forms. In these days of productivity driven approaches to labour management (sometimes reminiscent of time and motion analysis) such results as you describe are predictable. There is often a perception that any thinking that matters occurs in about the third tier of management and above. It takes considerable interaction at all levels in the organisation to dispel such perceptions. Stratification such as the \"town hall\" meetings only serve to reinforce these perceptions.  Breaking down the barriers of the heirarchical structure to provide true opportunities for interaction and collaboration sufficiently frequently can help enormously but often requires production downtime that management would prefer to avoid. For many organisations taking the risk of trading production time for innovation time has proved worthwhile. A key element in this is providing adequate feedback.
