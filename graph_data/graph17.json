I think the enforcing of 20 youths employed could be enforced by a contractual agreement between the conference organisers and the employers through, 1) implementing a system of traffic light signage + industry signage like stickers for the youngsters + employers. Maybe after the talks there would be opportunities for workshops where youngsters with similar industry interests as one employer could go over and participate and mingle with them. You would then switch your traffic light sticker for a green one and proudly stick the name of your new job on it! This would be a way to FACILITATE the idea, but not enforce it I guess.

Don't tear me up!  :)  I think Joshua's comment about vocation (on June 27th) really adds to this conversation.  I'd like to build on that.\r\rTHESIS:  A great purpose workshop should focus on the concept of vocation, not career.  This can be done by exposing young people to the works of great thinkers and writers who have struggled with this concept.  The book \"Leading Lives that Matter: What We Should Do and Who We Should Be\" could be a great start: \r\rBACKGROUND: I'm an engineer with a background in business design and social enterprise.  As most first-year MBA students I do quite a bit of thinking about career development and positioning.  Although I'm on the young end for our program, I get the strong impression that I've got a leg up on many of my classmates.  My suspicion is (gasp!) that it has something to do with my undergrad work in the humanities.\r\rTOOLS vs. POSTURES: If I had to explain this, I think I would do so by drawing a (somewhat arbitrary) distinction between tools and postures.  Engineering professors are infamous for using the tool metaphor to describe education.  Engineering courses like Computer Aided Design, Experimental Measurement, and Heat Transfer provide students with tools that can be immediately applied to solving real world, quantifiable problems.  Many of my colleagues come from disciplines with very similar characteristics: finance, accounting, physics, graphic design, etc.  \r\rHumanities programs do not typically provide pre-packaged, ready-to-use problem solving tools.  I have yet to encounter a problem that can be solved by simply applying Geertz's \"The Interpretation of Cultures\" or \"Kant's Foundations for the Metaphysics of Morals.\"  But for some reason, these readings seem to have been among the most important and valuable parts of my education.  I think this is because a humanities education, when properly executed, teaches one how to better approach life.  It teaches good posture.\r\rCONCLUSION: \r\rWhat I've found:\r\rTools (or Skills) are often what get you the job.  Good postures (curiosity, empathy, thoughtfulness, etc.)  are what make you successful, effective, and happy.\r\rMany universities are moving toward teaching only skills.  This is not all bad.  I'm convinced, however, that postures are just as, if not more, important.", "user": "2c5e871ae36e0773fbc00587d7067ac7", "date": "August 31, 2012, 01:59AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "purpose_workshops", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Steve - no risk of being torn up - great contribution and thoughts.

Who should lead this? If we are looking at asking this question at high school or university level, the question is who should lead this process? It must be remembered that since there are no right answers, there will have to be some form of guidance to the participants in this process.\r3. What are the outcomes that we want to achieve by asking the \"purpose question\". Obviously it is to give the individuals a sense of direction in life, but this must then be matched with what they are exposed to. Some answers may be too wide and will need to be honed in more specifically and live feedback is the only way to do this.\r4. Once the \"purpose question\" has been answered, then what? How do we support the purpose that has been identified by the individual? We need to recognise that the purposes can be wide ranging, and if we are asking this question at school level, it may be possible to direct the individual into the courses / training etc that would be relevant. But what if we are asking this question of a student at university who has already signed up for a specific programme without any conception of his / her purpose in life and only discovers this midway, and what he is currently doing is not in tandem with his purpose? Then what?\rI am in awe of what this concept tries to achieve and believe that, with the right direction and practical application, it is one that can and will change lives, one at a time.\rThe key component however must be to answer the following questions :\r1. What is the purpose of your life?\r2. Why is \"this\" the purpose?\r3. How can it be achieved?\r4. When do we ask the question?\r5. Where can we provide support for the people who have finally identified their purpose?\rI do hope that these comments are in the direction of your concept and do apologise if I have missed or misunderstood anything.

It's a great example of people coming together from around the world to answer some interesting questions with real-world benefit.\r\rThank you for taking the time to really think about the concept of Purpose Workshops, what it could look like and some of the challenges that might pop up.  It is a very generous contribution - thank you.  I will move through your points in order...\r\r1. How old should the people be to begin this process.\r\rYou know, I actually, think this process could begin quite early - even earlier than high school.  Obviously, there wouldn't be much in the way of answers at that point, and it would need to be framed very differently, but I think it likely that there is a way to get children engaging with the matter of purpose earlier than we think.  e.g. dream sessions - where kids are given permission to dream, share and celebrate them - be courageous about their dreams and stretch their thinking.  A kind of warm-up, if you like :-)  \r\rFor the purposes of *this* exercise, somewhat arbitrarily, I would pick the age of around about 15 years of age.  The reason for this is that hopefully increased sense of purpose will have the added benefit of improved secondary school retention rates - at the point in their studies this really becomes an issue.  If students are seeing their schooling through the lens of the purpose it will help them realise with their lives, perhaps they will stay engaged longer?  \r\rImportantly, a high school implementation also means that we won't only pick up those people who go on to higher education - we want to include people who want to go on to learn a trade or create their own business without going on to uni or polytech.\r\rAt 15 and older, the participants are also old enough that specialist paediatric development expertise probably won't be necessary, making it simpler to implement.\r\rI would be interested in your thoughts on this.\r\r2. Who should lead this?\r\rMost schools have careers advisors, yes?  Universities and Polytechnics tend to have careers centres too.  Perhaps these people could be trained to deliver in-person sessions with a pool of shared resources - video messages from giants in the corporate sector, non-profit world-changers, successful entrepreneurs, sporting champions - and live online sessions with some of the same?\r\r3.  What are the outcomes that we want to achieve by asking the \"purpose question\".\r\rI think it's actually helpful for the purpose to be somewhat general (Mine of \"contributing to a world where people dare to hope, dream and act to be everything they can be\" is fairly broad) but you're right there needs to be a focus or central idea which serves as the pivot for decision-making.  Essentially, mine is about realising potential - that's the central idea - the ways in which I can manifest that are many and varied.\r\r4. Once the \"purpose question\" has been answered, then what?\r\rGreat question.  I might build on/incorporate some of the other concepts I have seen posted on here to address this.  How do we support people to take their initial steps to giving life to their purpose?  How much support is appropriate?\r\rIn terms of what to do if they discover what they are doing is discordant with their desired life purpose?  I have a personal view on that which is that it's better not to throw good money and time after bad... I would say \"change what you're doing\".  Not always easy and I appreciate that for some with other competing priorities it might be something they have to delay but, ideally, the answer to that question would be about how people can realise a life which is aligned with their purpose - despite earlier decisions which they might have made.\r\rI'm very very grateful to you for your questions and contribution.  They are going to help immensely as I refine this concept - and I'm now painfully aware at just how little time I have left!!\r\rMy thanks and, again, welcome to OpenIDEO.

Age to start\r\rI absolutely agree with you that the ideal age to do this should be about 15 years. The idea of introducing this to younger children is also great and perhaps we can incorporate this into the curriculum under the civil society or civics or general skills subjects. This will give everyone a chance to build on their dreams and for the dreams to evolve with time.  And of course everyone should be included at age 15 and it should not be limited to people who may pursue higher education. Perhaps this will turn into a wonderful opportunity to give recognition and credit to all forms of productivity and not merely those society regards as 'worthy'. \r\rWhat I think must form an important part of this component is firstly that there should not be any dismissing of professions that the counsellors may feel are not up to the mark. Also background information about each individual is important for perspective eg the parents' occupations so that some sense of identification and connectivity can be made, where relevant, and perhaps role modeling can be linked to this as well where the parent or close relative is the source of inspiration. \r\r2. Who should lead this\r\rYou're absolutely right! It would be wonderful to start small with the counsellors being the initial guides for the students at school and university level.  However expanding it into the groups you have mentioned will make it a truly life defining engagement for these individuals.  You may want to check what The Laureus Foundation is doing specifically in the context of sports : www.laureus.com \r\rIf achieved to the levels you have mentioned, it will truly make a difference.\r\r3. Outcomes of the 'purpose' question\r\rAs you have mentioned, a general outcome will serve well initially although it is, I believe, imperative to ensure that there is proper and sufficient guidance to allow individuals to pare it down to specifics. If I may for example suggest that a 15 year old who sees himself as a rock star in the future may possibly achieve this dream but he will need to attend music lessons that support this dream.\r\rI believe the outcomes must not only open the door of opportunity in terms of dreams and goals, but also provide a specific sense of direction which must include equipping the individual with the relevant skills as he goes along. Using your specific example of age 15, if an individual is able to articulate his dreams and goals for the future at this point, someone must be able to point him in the right direction, clearly, logically and honestly. This will truly make your project impactful for every participant.\r\r4. Then what?\r\rI believe if this project can be incorporated, its evolution will result is early enough intervention to make this question redundant in the longer term, except in exceptional circumstances.\r\rThank you and all the best.", "user": "3e504e81dc65c578263e096db373dc23", "date": "September 04, 2012, 09:29AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "purpose_workshops", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "By participating in this process perhaps the students can discover and re-use elements here that they can apply to addressing other complex problems.

In addition, small firms would love to have flexible 'on demand' project teams which they can draw on as and when they workflow suits - especially in a recession, when small companies have a hugely fluctuating workload.\rIn many ways the admin has been taken off their hands. Contracts can be pre-determined by the agency, all the employers have to do is log on and choose some interns. No more searching through hundreds of out of date CVs. \rAs young people are also taking part in competitions, we could consider asking them to display a 'sponsored by' badge on any submissions - so employers get some credit for their input. \r- I absolutely agree about confidentiality and training. It has to be asked whether employers are going to wish to invest in these young people if they are only there for a short period, which leads onto your second point about employers exploiting the young people for repetitive labour.  As I as mentioned to Paul below, I think a rating system would be very helpful. The young people are encouraged to rate the quality of experience they got from the employer. This will be shown on their profile, and so under performing firms will find it hard to get good young people to accept their offers of experience in the future. Firms that perform well could be given an accreditation which they can display on their website etc, like an ebay 'power user' in some ways I suppose.  \r- With regard to your third point, there would certainly need to be manpower to administrate the running of the scheme. This could be paid for by charging employers a small fee to hire teams, to become a featured employer (creating a more prominent profile, encouraging greater interest from young people) or advertising (would a large company sponsor the entire scheme, for example Barclay's Youth Excellence Scheme?).\rI hope this answers some of your questions and I'd love to hear thoughts!", "user": "d9ebac00ba63f50a8c724e3d1d021354", "date": "September 14, 2012, 09:21PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "businesses_employ_unpaid_young_people_to_take_part_in_competitions_set_by_a_central_body._", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "In an effort to get an industry perspective and further develop Lydia, Brandon and my own ideas, I run an early version of the concept by a small local Architectural firm. This is a rough transcript of the conversation followed by some ideas I think we can take forward from it. Please do comment your thoughts so we can all improve and refine this concept!\r\r\rConversation with Inspiration Architects, Berkshire:\r\rOzzy: [Explains concept]\r\rBrian: So who enters the competition, the students or the companies?\r\rOzzy: The companies would enter the competition, and recruit the help of a group of students.\r\rBrian: So the students are basically doing an unpaid internship?\r\rOzzy: Yes they are. The reason behind including a competition element is to encourage companies without much work to take on interns by creating work for the young people to be doing.  Then hopefully the companies wouldnt miss out on the benefits of the scheme, like publicity, a group of forward looking, skilled young people to provide a fresh perspective on projects and manpower to help with the day to day running of the business.\r\rBrian: I think you should consider what your idea actually is. What are you going to set up? Is it an agency who companies can contact and are given a team of young people? Should student approach them as a team and ask? Or guidelines to employ interns?\r\rOscar: Yes, there could be an online agency side to it. I think its important for the young people that they have an opportunity to contact businesses themselves, so I had always imagined that individuals would search on a website for local accredited companies and then contact them personally. Accreditation for the company would come as a part of being involved.\r\rBrian: Im not really sure what youre accrediting, what is the difference between going through the website and doing it off your own back? Maybe the website could be a networking portal between students to find other people who want to participate in the competition. The new group can then approach companies and ask for them for sponsorship. This sponsorship would comprise of a workplace working environment and the company banner to compete under for example. By going through the website student know they are going to get a good deal from companies and not get exploited. The payback for a company is an on demand, flexible workforce. \r\rOscar: So, as an employer, would you be interested in getting accredited and being able to employ a group of people from a dedicated website?\r\rBrian: Yes I would. The difficult thing for us at the moment is finding skilled people when you want them.  As a small company in a really tough time for Architecture, our workload is fluctuating constantly. We need a flexible workforce of skilled people. Short term, flexible and free work is a very attractive idea, especially if I can go to a website, see the students who are looking for places, see their experience and skill level and choose who I want. \r\rOscar: Do you not get offers of free work from students at the moment? \r\rBrian: Yes, from individuals every now and again. \r\rOscar: In that case, couldnt you just employ them without the hassle of the website?\r\rBrian: Well they all want different lengths of contract, are individuals so cant be put in a team for a project and probably wont be available at the time we get a big job through the door. Id want to hire who I want, on demand. \r\rOscar: Would the competition element be a hindrance then?\r\rBrian: I see the competition as slightly peripheral from my point of view. But maybe the website can offer suggestions to employers as to how best they can use the 50% of time they get when the students arent doing competition work. Also, who is paying for this?\r\rOscar: I was thinking that large companies could sponsor the competitions that students spend 50% of their time on, so effectively outsource a project to the web of students and accredited companies. They would pay a fee for the privilege and in return get advertising, experience from countless students and professionals and rights to use the resulting ideas.\r\rBrian: Well I dont think theyd need to do it. Companies were doing competitions like this all the time in Architecture and basically ripped people off for their ideas  so much so the RIBA had to publish competition guidelines. Rather than pay to get a bunch of students to come up with ideas, they could call up industry press and get it publicised for free to working professionals.\rCould the website trall the Internet for running competitions and then accredit them if they are within guidelines? Students could spend 50% of their time doing those. \r\rOscar: Definitely. That is actually very similar to another idea that a different openIDEA member had for this project.\r\rOscar: So a student agency like the one we have just discussed would be attractive to you as an employer?\r\rBrian: Yes it would.", "user": "d9ebac00ba63f50a8c724e3d1d021354", "date": "August 29, 2012, 11:35PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "businesses_employ_unpaid_young_people_to_take_part_in_competitions_set_by_a_central_body._", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "A couple of thoughts:\r\r1: A service for the provision of short term, on demand workforces of skilled young people might be in demand. \r\r2: Individuals use a site as a networking base then approach accredited companies asking them to 'sponsor' the group to compete in a chosen competition. Young people get a set of specific sponsorship benefits (a workplace, advice, 50% of their work time spent working in industry, resources and rights to their ideas).\r\r3: Companies search for interns. As above but the businesses can also ask specific individuals or groups to receive their sponsorship based on their skills, experience and group size. The business benefits from a free, skilled and most importantly on-demand workforce that spends 50% of it's time working for the company.\r\rA site that seems allow companies to actually choose interns is http://www.urbaninterns.com - do you think that businesses would be put off by young people interning as groups and working on personally chosen competitions for 50% of the time, or would the like the idea of having their name on a competition entry for free?\r\rIn addition, the thing that differentiates this idea from urbaninterns is the assurance of standardised and fair terms for both parties, the safety of a group dynamic for those who are apprehensive of the workplace and a competition element to give young people time to focus on what really interests them while getting them used to a working environment.

You definitely have the largest risk on the business side and that is what the expert panel wanted you to explore more deeply. Therefore, I think the biggest challenge is how do you make it a valuable proposition to the business to take on your concept compared to whats out there. Will business want to participate in competitions as well as hire students?\r\rWhat if you offered student services to solve real problems companies have vs. having companies compete against each other. Perhaps you could gather more interest in something that has direct benefits to real company problems. \r\rFor example, there are multi-disciplinary projects that MBA programs offer their students as a perk and as well as a service to businesses in the community.  These types of programs are designed to give students real-world experience while extending the MBA programs reach into the professional community.\r\rFor example, here is some marketing literature for how Ross Business Schools program works:\r\rhttp://www.bus.umich.edu/MAP/Dev/WhatisMAP.htm\r\rYoull noticed after reviewing it, Ross sells their programs to companies by offering the following benefits:\r\r1) (Access to Human Capital) Access to top-notch findings and recommendations from MBA students who have diverse skills, knowledge, backgrounds, and work experience\r2) (Minimal Cost) Minimal cost for the sponsoring organization; these solutions come at a fraction of the cost of a paid consultant\r3) (Access to Tools & Process) Access to analytical tools and methods that are often not available within sponsoring organizations\r\rTherefore, how can we differentiate this particular concept program that youre proposing and make it enticing to businesses? It seems like we wouldnt want to compete in a similar space - therefore, the following questions come to mind:\r\rAre there certain segments of students who have valuable skills that organizations could use, but arent currently being used? \rIs there a way to use technology to make interfacing with students and businesses easier?\rHow could we reduce the ways that it would cost employers to use our concept?\rHow can we make it valuable to the business (i.e solving problems they actually have vs. what the central body think they have)?\r\rCHARACTERISTICS OF SOLUTION:\r\rType of skill offered (purely analytical (A), highly creative (C))\rTechnology Interface (little to none/in person (N), internet based (I))\rCompany Overwatch (hands off (HO), hand-held (HH))\rProject Choice (business-driven (BD), central body driven(CB))\rStudent Selection (open (O), highly selective (HS))\rHire Criteria (project based (PrB), position based (PosB))\r\rYou can see what happens when you brainstorm across these various spectrums (link to my sketch) \r\rSCENARIOS:\r\rhttp://www.slideshare.net/bmcnamara/feedback-open-ideo-challenge-helping-young-people-work\r\rScenario #1: Focusing solely on analytical students, this solution would be a high touch, in-person experience. Students would be directed through the experience on a business driven project based on a need theyve pre-determined. To be hired, students will be required to fit the project based requirement. To be considered, youll have to pass a highly selective criteria established to only filter through students who are serious to committing to this work as well as making previous history of accomplishments. \r\rScenario #2: Focusing more both analytic and creative students. this solution would be some technology based as well as in-person consultation. Students would be largely self-directed, with minimal inputs required by the business. A central body would identify types of competitions and then find companies interested in participating. Students would be filled based on a position versus a project/competition based requirement. \r\rScenario #3: Focusing solely on creative / arts background students, this solution would be internet driven and high interaction / instruction on the organization hiring the student. Organizations would determine what type of projects / positions they would need to be filled and the competition they are interested in participating in. Rather than focusing on a particular project need - the student would be hired based on a position theyd like to grow into. Theyd be able to shadow that individual at the company who is a professional. \r\rPOTENTIAL CONCEPT: Thinking through these scenarios brought to mind a new concept, its a blend of the OpenIDEO / 99Designs concept:\r\r1) A company sets up a challenge or problem that they are facing. the give all the background information required to get started as well as keeping open a Q&A section to answer as many student questions as possible. A challenge has a fixed time schedule. \r\r2) Students can apply to work on these challenges based on their interest/background. Using their LinkedIn profile, the students signal that they are working on the challenge and can arrange with other individuals.\r\r3) Companies rate and select the winner / winning team. They are then contracted to implement / continue working on the project for \r\r4) Seems like there are benefits to all groups:\rWinning Students get real work experience which can be leveraged for future opportunities\rNon-winning students have a portfolio and as well as a certificate of completion which can be used for signaling to future employers of their skills. They can show that they worked on the UPS Challenge or the Google Challenge and list that as experience in their profile. \rCompanies get real problems they have potentially solved\r\rHOW DO YOU DO IT?\r\r1. Go where companies are already established and can reduce the search cost for finding talent (i.e. LinkedIn). \r\r2. Make it a requirement that all students sign up with Linkedin, this lowers the search cost for companies who are reviewing what students they want to hire.\r\r3. How can we lower the cost of hiring? What if you hired the students? Allow the companies to contract with your concept vs. being required to hire the students. Its easier to hire a contractor vs. hire a full time employee. Perhaps you do this as a non-profit?\r\r4. Create tiny barriers to filter out students who arent serious about gaining experience. Free work can attract students who might not be 100% committed to the experience. Create small filtering criteria (i.e answering a few small questions, having them write what they hope to learn and how they would apply this to future work, ect.)

Joining this idea with Lydia's, maybe an individual could sign up to a site (integrated with linkedIN?) and upload their experience / interests. They are then given a range of accredited *external* competitions to choose from. Companies also sign up to the site, upload information about themselves and how many people they wish to employ (or sub-contract) at that time. Then, it is up to both parties to make it happen. Young people apply as an individual or a group to companies. By using the website, young people are guaranteed a workplace, advice and 50% of their time to be spent on the competition they have chosen. The other 50% would be on anything the company needs at the time. On the other hand, businesses can also search for young people. They can see how large the group is and what experience they have before actually asking the young people to come and work for them. The benefit for them is a flexible, free and temporary semi-skilled workforce that spend 50% of their time helping the company with whatever they need doing. \r\rTake a look at the transcript and resulting insights to see the reasons for this idea, and thank again for the time you spent on these suggestions, I'm still working through all your ideas!", "user": "d9ebac00ba63f50a8c724e3d1d021354", "date": "August 29, 2012, 11:15PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "businesses_employ_unpaid_young_people_to_take_part_in_competitions_set_by_a_central_body._", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "We're currently facing a bug which may prevent you from being able to directly update your concept post.

The young people must be out of work and local to the area, which will put a small company on an equal footing with a large international corporation.

Investors in People is relevant although slightly different, and giving an accreditation to participating companies would certainly be an incentive to get involved. A downside might be that you can't regulate team size, investment from host companies or project briefs but the criteria you suggest would certainly help keep accredited competitions broadly the same.\r\rI would suggest that creating a new competition structure is helpful in two ways. Firstly and most importantly, competition criteria can be regulated to keep the scheme as helpful and relevant to the young people as possible (team size, project briefs, turnaround time etc). Projects can also be created for industries that don't currently have the myriad of competition options currently open to designers, for example the construction or banking industries (teams could be asked to build an earthquake resistant prototype house or get the biggest return on a small investment respectively). Secondly, with the large network of accredited companies (I love the accreditation idea!) linked into the brand, large firms may well pay money to sponsor briefs. This would provide money to run the website and pay those running it.  \r\rA 'Gold Standard' as you suggest would certainly be helpful, especially if an online resource allows you to find schemes in your area. I think in some ways the strength of the concept is that anyone, no matter what industry they want to go into, gets an equal chance to experience a little bit of their chosen career, and the short turnaround time (2-3 months?) means it is not a huge commitment that restricts job hunting.

Now, more than ever people know aren't buying the work 9-5 til you die regime, instead they just feel dead and bored at work. But surprisingly, a lot of people will use their nights working on things they do care about, and often for free. Which leaves them in a tough financial situation. You work on things together that you don't care about to pay the bills, and work on the things you do care about alone for free. StartupHostel flips this. Having StartupHostels based in 3rd world countries guests can keep their costs down to barely nothing, providing them with the opportunities to travel and collaborate on the things they care about, while learning highly demanded skills that they can take with them anywhere. They may even form their own profitable companies together at the hostels! the other pain point StartupHostel solves is for businesses as there is a serious lack of highly skilled and motivated people available for employment, and when they do exist, they are often working on their own things! StartupHostel helps businesses in this way by hooking them up with guests that need work.

StartupHostel is the first to be all year round. And when mixed with multiple locations, work opportunities, recruitment, hackathons, and facility hire for events - we got a winning combination for guests, businesses and hostels. I am unaware of anything that solves providing a home and opportunities to the passionate doers of the world even remotely as well as StartupHostel does.\r\r## How easy is this concept to implement and maintain?\rIt will be rather straightforward to put together, providing a dedicated team can afford to live for a few months and do the initial legwork fulltime. After that, revenue opportunities should allow it to be self financed. That initial stretch is the hardest bit as there are so many pieces that have to come together.\r\r## What type of organisation is best placed to take this forward?\rI would say that a standard company with the assistance of local governments, non-profits, startups, businesses etc. However, I don't see why others couldn't work too, just that standard company is easiest and most straightforward.\r\r## Overall, how do you feel about this concept?\rHonestly, it rocks my world. I can't wait to team up with a whole bunch of people and turn this into a reality. Having personally been through the pain that this would solve, I can't wait to free others from that pain and empower them with new amazing opportunities. I want to close the gap between beginner and expert, and provide a home and opportunities for the passionate doers of the world.", "user": "e14ed1a7c2087474a96dc486569fdff1", "date": "September 06, 2012, 11:02AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "youthhostel", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Dude.

There are forums for gaming, IT, DJs, VJs and many other branches. Usually these forums are very active and you do not need extra push for proffesionals to go there. Design of the forum interface is usually ugly, but funcional. It is the best place to find information and share skills, just have to find a Fun-way how to make it work  as a learning tool.\rQuestion of motivation? I dont believe in lonely genius idea and learning in small teams is always more motivating.  \r\rLearning by doing(gaming). Real life games like Geocaching  are getting more popular nowadays. I have  tried it ones, and I was surprised, that in so small time you learn so much new... and... it makes so much fun.  So, maybe, there is a way how to use gaming/learning like a drive which is based on these Forums for professionals?

How can they develop a sense of risk taking realizing that having been able to tick all the boxes on the job description is not all what you need to be a good candidate? This is difficult I think and it goes down to mindset and how you value people. There might be something about the recruitment process. If you haven't got this email from Sandra, you would have never known of her. I know someone who was told in the same week by the HR manager of an international business school that she was very unlikely to get a research position because her research interests and skills were a very poor fit for the school and got an invitation to come to give a job talk in that same school, and eventually got the job as a faculty. Interesting gap isn't it? I'm not saying that we should get rid of HR but sometime they might not have the same perspective. Maybe we need to explain them better what we need and give them more freedom, or get more involved.\r\rOn the applicants side: how can you learn how to present your maybe not so relevant experience in a way that can be attractive? It is about confidence and communication. The confidence can come from sharing stories as yours and a few others in this inspiration phase. It is then also important to provide applicants with a better understanding of communication tools, beyond the traditional resume that might not allow them to do so. \r\rInteresting paths to explore for the concepting phase!", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "June 17, 2012, 02:42PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "no_experience_irrelevant_experience_is_there_such_thing_let_s_give_them_a_chance", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for your feedbacks and the issues you discuss.\rIf anything, I tried to share my experience where candidates who didn't fit on paper, did much better and more than some who appeared to be a good fit CV-wise.

After that I introduced them to the challenge and they started the ideation process followed by prototyping. \r\rBecause of the precarious conditions of the emergency centers where these teens lived, the curriculum was delivered only for two weeks, and repeated twice with different groups. It may seem short, but I believe it made an impact. I spent approximately $1,500 in materials. Also, we used reclaimed materials and hundreds of plastic lids donated by companies. Before heading to Colombia, I hosted a fundraising event that gave me $600. iDo at SF State University donated $400 and I put $500 of my own money plus my time and the coverage of all my travel and living expenses. \r\rIdeally, it would require affiliation with a design school as under perfect conditions, this curriculum could be constantly delivered. You see the teenagers live in this place for a period of 3 to 4 weeks. That means that if there are two pilot 2 week curriculums, they could be re-delivered once a month by a different group of designers on a different group of students. \r\rI think for this challenge, it would be wonderful if the curriculum was delivered by people already in the industry. That is designers or firms willing to give a percentage of their time to teach design. That way the teens could get a glimpse of the real design world and perhaps be given an opportunity as interns.

My other concern is that it seems just like existing community workshops aimed at small businesses but now aimed at youths instead, which I'm not sure would help solve youth unemployment as such a service would teach students a lot of generalised knowledge in many different areas (making them a novice at everything), versus specialised knowledge in an in-demand skill that employers are looking for (pro at something). Whereas with incubators/accelerators/hacker-schools they all focus on one precise skill area that is in-demand and work it up to rockstar levels.

Recently ran into OpenIDEO...What a great tool! This is an interesting idea to address a critical global issue. I definitely see areas for potential collaboration with other projects as well. For example, the YouthCafe project may overlap in the sense that meetups could be held in Lab 21s. Also, theres the important issue of incentives for local business involvement (an avenue to increase community ownership and sustainability) and integrating Open IDEO-like challenges. The two could be merged. I would assume a thorough interview/assessment process would take place for each new youth member in which key career-oriented questions were asked (a great place to integrate the Purpose Workshops idea as an intake tool). After each youth member has a unique profile, the information could be analyzed to flesh out key topic areas/industries. Then, local businesses would be identified that would match those areas as close as possible. Those businesses would be approached about potential partnerships and the idea of developing OpenIDEO-like challenges specifically targeted to address institutional areas in which they want to innovate and/or current business issues that need to be solved.  \r\rYouth benefit from the hands-on experience and learning about the inner-workings/dynamics of organizations doing work aligned with their interests and values. Local businesses benefit from being exposed to IDEO methodologies as well as from the actual work to help them solve key business challenges. It would be important though, to send a message regarding the value of the youths work by offering reasonable payment for services. All the participating businesses, for example, could commit a pre-determined donation in order to become official partner organizations and that money could go to a stipend for the youth(s) assigned to their respective projects.

I definitely would want a membership to a place like this.\r\rI wanted to ask you whether you have had much of an opportunity to explore some of the other concepts in the refinement stage yet? I didn't get to see all of the comments on this concept, and I'm a little new to openIDEO, so I apologize if this has already been mentioned - but it seems to me that some of the other concepts would work well in coordination with LAB 21.\r\rI saw that someone else mentioned the Mobile DIY lab, and I think that this could be a great forum for the concept \"Young + Unemployed Conference\" (you mentioned conferences in the description, if I remember correctly).

It's ultimate goal is to have \"deep dive\" project-based classes added to curriculums in schools.\r\rHere's what I was thinking - secondary schools would sponsor \"challenges\" at LAB 21, being long-term projects that kids could work on throughout the year - they could be about anything, potentially created by teachers and students from the schools. These challenges could be extra-curricular programs that are group-based, where groups come to LAB 21 to do their work. For the students, it gives them a new type of learning style they're not always exposed to in school, and gives them something to do after school. For you, it would mean the active involvement of a local organization. And, it could be a first step towards integrating \"deep dive\" education into schools - a structure that allows schools to see how that type of learning works before committing to incorporating it into their curriculums.\r\rThese \"challenges\" could also be adapted as a recruiting tool for businesses - they could sponsor \"challenges\" that relate to their line of work.

On the other hand the definition of unemployed is someone who has not performed more than 1 hour of paid work in a three month period (that is the manipulation that keeps the reported unemployment rate at low levels). Because this figure is so grossly abused a second term has been introduced called participation rate but this too is subject to manipulation - it consists of those in paid work plus those actively looking for work (people the general public would regard as unemployed).

All had \"failed\" at school and/or college.

And 2) How could you develop this to include young people who have already left school?

There are dozens (hundreds?) of individual employability initiatives throughout the country and some are very good indeed. However, any sort of a accreditation/award at a \"local\" level naturally has proportionally less value than something nationally recognised. Scalability is therefore key. \r\rOne of the nice things about this concept is that it is eminently scalable using web technologies and the fact that a common curriculum/rubrick/taxonomy will cover the whole country. A perfect example of something being performed in a particular industry is the Bloomberg Assessment Test (BAT) and I encourage fellow OpenIDEO folks to check it out for inspiration: https://www.bloomberginstitute.com/bat/start/\rI have met with the Bloomberg people in London and been shown what they are doing first hand. It's most impressive and the concept is a perfect base on which to build a similar solution for employability skills.\r\r2) Including young people who have left school: Back to the idea of scalability, if employability skills are on the curriculum at school then the solution is (relatively) neat, and I understand that Carole is going to be meeting with Michael Gove to explore how this could work. However, once people have left school then the provision of the skills teaching and assessment can be provided by the private sector.. An organisation like the Association of Employment and Learning Providers (http://www.aelp.org.uk/) is perfectly placed to help coordinate this and Graham Hoyle OBE is already enthusiastic about the idea. With a common taxonomy to work to, suddenly service providers will no longer be a heterogeneous collection of 100s of small outfits, but will become a powerful coalition working towards the same goal.\r\r3) A proper name: This is important, and sadly quite hard! I hope the creativity of OpenIDEO members can be brought to bear on this. My initial suggestion would to find a pronounceable acronym which included the name of the organisation willing to sponsor the initiative e.g. Barclays Employability Taxonomy (BET), but better! \r\rMany thanks, \rJohn\r\rhttp://www.theworkfoundation.com/Reports/273/Employability-and-Skills-in-the-UK-Redefining-the-debate", "user": "a59033d65080f2909a25cc1c81301f5a", "date": "August 27, 2012, 11:03AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "employers_have_the_answers_..._if_asked_the_right_questions", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Further thoughts on the scale-ability: 1) If the skills required are broken down by the employers into smaller parts until they are no longer disagreed on then we can process the skills descriptors into learning outcomes which can be taught at all levels in the education system.  Quality assurance can be ensured if employers are willing to get involved in the delivery of the skills & assessment of the skills at school higher education levels.  Education institutions at all levels ought to be working with employers so having an employability theme running through the education programmes should provide the perfect opportunity for engagement between academia and industry.  Using an industry recognised standard skills taxonomy will ensure everyone is on the same page. I agree the Bloomberg BAT test is a great example.\r\r2) Involving young people who have already left school: An \"after school\" club format is one idea to help young people who have just left school but which could be run on local company premises, co hosted by either the local council or an approved skills provider with young people self selecting based on their preferred industry.  This concept comes back to the idea of employers being involved in the delivery and assessment of the skills at school and higher education level.  Hosting skills evenings would offer employers and local councils an opportunity to engage in outreach.\r\r3): An employability taxonomy is not very catchy is it!

This would be comparable to the initial tryouts on American Idol(This concept was inspired by the Occupational Idol concept). A person who has a concept presents it live using a hangout to a panel of judges. The role of the judges is not to eliminate, but to offer ideas to help build on the presenter's concept. It would be nice, not required, if the panel of judges were experienced IDEOers, with occasional celebrity guest rockstars from the design world. As Hangout events are live and recorded, the global audience can watch, learn, praise and comment on the live hangout chat stream, or asynchronously on the recorded Youtube in the comments section. This would be valuable to the concept presenter as they could watch themselves after the presentation and also see what judges and the larger Youtube audience thinks. Other OpenIDEOer's with concepts could watch, learn and build on cool things they learned while watching their predecessors.( I am a big fan of social learning) Concepts could be presented, for example, at up to 3 hangout events, giving presenters the opportunity to learn and present their improved concept. Right now, I am experimenting with creating a live hangout event from my cell phone to bring openideo concept hangout events into the field for live human interaction with the real world. \rCheers!", "user": "876caf881055173ada9c5c3a1883a079", "date": "August 09, 2012, 03:06PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "openideo_live_with_google_plus_hangouts_on_the_air", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Great stuff Rob!

Here's my notes. \r\r1. I recorded the hangout, live to Youtube, however, as I was the only participant, so I deleted it. Who wants to look at me talking to me for 30 minutes:)\r2. As this hangout event was not announced in advance and was just a test to see how hangouts might work, no people were actually presenting their concepts, so no new concepts were created.. this time.\r3. Google Hangouts, of course, only allows up to 10 people in a room collaborating at a time. However, I have been in other hangouts where each of the cam's in the hangout are actually small groups of students in a physical place together. For example, I have been in a hangout where groups of ~10 students each from from USC, Standford and MIT design classes, were meeting to collaborate on a project. In this case, 3 cams=~30 students from 3 campuses were hanging out, with the possibility to add other groups for the 7 other cams from other campuses. And of course, the number of people at each one of the locations could be much greater than 10.\r4. Would I limit the amount of participants in the live event? Yes and No. It would depend on the purpose of the event. For example, as you may recall, this concept is building on the \"Occupational Idol\" concept, where, as on the TV show, you would like millions to watch as the person/team presents their concept to the world, live through YouTube video. The number of cams actually \"in the hangout\" are limited to 10, with perhaps 2 for the \"Challenge Sponsors\" 3 reserved for the \"celebrity panel\", 1 for the hangout host/moderator and 4 concept presenters. As with the TV show, each of the 4 who will be presenting their concepts will rotate through to present. Of course the larger audience watching the YouTube may not enter the hangout by cam, but they may participate, by chatting in the event stream that is part of the hangout event. For example, here is the chat stream from this test hangout, from the other day. https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c0ge2mfd3aa4stdi99p17fm1u8k/114080389079195774312\r5. If the purpose of the hangout is to do design work, rather than showcase the concept, my personal preference is for no more than 7 people on a team or in a hangout at a time. I base this somewhat on personal experience and an abstraction of Metcafe's Law http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law where communications become asymptotically more complicated when the number of people participating increases.", "user": "876caf881055173ada9c5c3a1883a079", "date": "July 05, 2012, 04:14AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "openideo_live_with_google_plus_hangouts_on_the_air", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for the tip about Shaina's concept!

The expert panel asked \"how you make young entrepreneurs aware of it\" which is a good question.  The benefit of this idea isn't just the people who are successful but everyone who learns from the process and other people's successes/failures.  A few thoughts (from a marketeer):  \r\r- Find your communities of young entrepreneurs.  Scour Facebook/tumblr/Twitter for those who are starting businesses - where do they hang out and ask advice for business plans and funding? Start reaching out to them and also seeding honest, non-intrusive messages in the right forums, etc.   \r- Build in a mechanic that spreads itself (cf. Kickstarter).  Some form of 'gamification' could really help the concept broadcast itself, i.e. the top projects are opened up to a vote online where the project team need others to like/vote/recommend, or, a portion of funding needs to be generated online from donors with a bank/creditor matching or topping up (again, creating visibility from a wider group of people and passing on the idea of ALT/Loan)\r- Identify advocates and influencers; who is famous for championing and celebrating young entrepreneurs?  This can be everyone from governments & Bill Gates to local businesspeople.  These people will actively communicate your idea as they personally believe in it, they will also likely contribute skills and time\r- Find business partners (e.g. bank/creditor) as they will lend credibility and often funds for marketing materials\r- Develop an information pack/program for schools & teacher advocates.  The process will get smoother when its repeated.  Schools are also well set-up to host events and workshops, as well as having the right audience you want to speak to.  \r- Find charity partners (e.g. envision/IntoUniversity/Young Enterprise in UK) which work with young people and probably already have access\r\rHope that sparks some ideas!", "user": "2307a343d68be73ab45fcd564425ac5e", "date": "September 10, 2012, 09:42PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "training_wheels_redesigning_loans_to_fit_young_businesses", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Fab collaborative conversations here guys  great to see this concept grow!", "user": "0ebfe65ca16ea82675e4294e27747639", "date": "September 02, 2012, 10:13PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "training_wheels_redesigning_loans_to_fit_young_businesses", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hey Erica!\rGreat that our concepts made it into refinement, let's think together!\rI love how your concept helps young people get a feeling for business before they apply for a loan.\rThe feeling i got from my feedback, is that it's a challenge to come up with a value proposition for banks high enough for them to actually take the risk of supporting someone so young & inexperienced. \rMore and more I am getting the feeling banks are experts in late funding, and maybe it's better if it stays that way?\r\rYour support platform will come in handy here:\r\rMaybe the mentors will be able to help find alternative funding possibilities.

I've been trying to think of the major types of risk inherent in new businesses and new entrepreneurs and possible ways to counter them:\r\rCREDIT RISK (i.e. is this person/business likely to repay the loan?)\rIn a new businesses with a younger person, this risk seems two-part \ra) do they have a good plan and \rb) will they stick with the project. \rInitially I was thinking to reduce this risk by increasing information that the bank has on the applicants by watching them go through the process of a business simulation/startup weekend/bootcamp. Their successful completion of such a project and completion of a financial model for their project and repayment should help with credit risk.\rAdditionally, at least in the US, small business loans and student loans are generally backed by the government. This is less desirable to build into the profit model, but it's definitely an important influence in the loan market.\r\rOPERATIONAL RISK (i.e. will the business fly?)\rMany loans on the market reduce operational risk by targeting loans for equipment (that could be resold in case of default) or funding expansion of working capital/inventory in established businesses. We're trying to do something else here, and aiming to reduce operational risk through\ra) building a data foundation of a set of new-school business plans and execution data (i.e. the financial progress data) to support a positive feedback loop of learning that allows the bank to efficiently lend small amounts for predictable business models and to flag operational problems before they kill the business. This is the kind of role that Angels/a board often play, but which isn't very scalable or consistent in quality.\rb) education up-front and mentorship during the life of the loan should increase the chance of execution success.\r________________________________________________\r\rIf you're still thinking about further developing a concept for higher-risk projects Breakout Labs (http://www.breakoutlabs.org/home.html) from Peter Thiel's Thiel Foundation might be interesting to you: They have a panel of experts vet high-risk nacent science and technology projects that they fund for up to $300,000, then projects repay once they gain traction and the foundation doesn't retain any long-term stake in the company but does get a solid return on the investment which will then go to fund other projects. It's a cool, potentially stable way to get companies off the ground without hamstringing them into selling half their company just to get started...\r________________________________________________\r\rThe idea of successful kickstarters as mentors reminded me of a succes story along those lines that you might like: http://craigmod.com/journal/kickstartup/\r\rThe Ouya project is a really interesting case. I know a lot of people are having success raising money through the platform, but even some of them who've been working on their products for a long time are having some trouble making good on the pledges they promised to their backers. The project that you pointed to is a great example of the challenges...it seems like an execution miracle if they'll be able to get through the regulatory process, assemble the first complete working units and ship ~60,000 units in the next seven months!\r\rDo you know anything about them?

The reason I ask is that I think youd need different resources depending on who youd be targeting to. If Im pre-revenue, Im probably more interested in learning a white space in the market and how Id build my product. If I already have revenue, perhaps Im interested in how to scale and grow my businesses. \r\rOn the bank side, what if you targeted this program for small to medium size banks who were looking to expand their community development? This could be a customized program they could adopt without having to establish the framework and the technology. Similar to Stefans comment, what if they partnered with local angel investors whod be able to help share some of the risk and expert network?\r\rI thought this article below was good at explaining the challenges that banks have with making small loans, perhaps this could spark some insights on how to navigate around it:\r\rhttp://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/a-banker-explains-why-small-businesses-have-trouble-getting-credit/\r\rHOW TO MAKE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS AWARE?\r\rIn the US, there are events called Startup Weekends, where a bunch of individuals interested in building a product gather together for 48 hours.

My question is around how you will pitch this to schools -- while the demand for this sort of program is probably there, how do you take a full day (plus preparation) out of scheduled curriculum?

But i would like there to me an organization that focuses a more on the work, and experiences, the prep for real life. \rI would pitch this idea to schools by explaining the ground idea, giving the kids experience and inputs of the work marked. Giving them a realistic view on the \"real\" world. And hopefully giving them a pointer to their dream job. Inspiring them to work hard. I would also say that the schools are there to prepare the youth for the working life, and what better to prepare them for it, than some hands on experience? The charity part of it, will in addition give the school a good name. \r\rWhen it comes to roadblocks there are probably a lot of schools in the beginning not open for it. Loosing one day or week to this, but when they see the benefits they get at other schools, and feedback from the students, I think a lot of schools will change their minds. Maybe it will take a few years before things really take of. But with good PR, hopefully not to long. \r\rHaving a plan ready for the schools who choose to do this, would help not making it too much extra work.  \r\rThe site http://www.odwusa.org/ is for the american part of the organization that inspired me. I see that they could use some more PR and a more hands on, go out there organization base. Getting more people informed and inspired by their good work.

A couple of ideas: Can you provide employers/HR departments with incentives to stay abreast of youth websites/causes? Can you partner workplace mentors with youth so they feel supported through the process? Can employers login to the youth's website to participate?

There is typically this barrier created by the branding activity of a company on a market plus informal rumors which does not help at all for recruiting purposes (on both sides). There is a lack of space for professionals to collaborate, build knowledge and share it. Stereotyping is a barrier, and to me it is a result of lack of knowledge / understanding. It is about breaking this glass-barriers, these fish-tanks, through flow of information. \r\rThere are some trends already in a space that is close to this one, such as the so called 'coopetition', which builds on the collaboration of professionals to be more competitive (breaking boundaries to move ahead faster), playing in the boundary between cooperating while competing. In our case, the collaborative content would also help professionals within the same space in different companies understand better their roles in other companies. How many times have we heard 'I am a management consultant' and yet the type of projects the professional is engaged changes dramatically from one professional to another? Access to info allows for people seeing through better, which allows for the 'market chaos' to organize.\r\rI once made a project for the Barcelona townhole, and I had this interesting conversation with the responsible of mobility of the city (this is the person in charge of urban police, transport and so on to ensure everything flows smoothly).

I fully agree that we've seen a lot of potential coming out of virtual networks in the last years and we have also seen networks evolve, such as linkedin or facebook finding their way through use and value. \r\rI would agree with you that at this point the concept is addressing a wide scope of public and possibly sectors. I understand there should be a proper design process, but in my opinion and as an initial starting point the design of the concept should build on:\r\r1) The platform should be open to organize content by contributors as it grows, so that as it is being used it would find the right shape to encompass different areas. For instance, venture capitalist may find a challenge to find balanced teams for their investments, so they would start feeding the platform with their learnings on the teams, typical unbalanced teams failures, typical new requirements difficult to find... while entrepreneurs may start feeding the system with their own experiences ... what they missed, what their experience was with VCs, etc ... so two different 'clouds' of content would be created ... and as content grows the two clouds would meet (VCs content meet Entrepreneurs'; and Entrepreneurs' content meet VCs' content)\r\r2) Each professional contributing to the platform is somehow identified and some sort of feedback from the network in terms of usefulness is also published (in order to encourage professionals to participate, to contribute and be recognized by other professionals too). Twitter is a network that is somehow doing so in its own way. Foursquare is somehow doing this too. The work-pedia should have its own way too.\r\r3) The platform should allow for contacting/interacting with professionals, but probably should not necessarily build 'virtual relationships'. An extreme of virtual relationship to me would be linkedin (there is normally a bond between members that connect, and even the concept of connection is already there steadily) or facebook (through the 'friend' concept). The work-pedia in my opinion would not focus on the relationship so much but on the content (closer to a wiki-pedia) while allowing for interaction between members. The more interaction requests a member has, the more recognition the system should reward him with.\r\r4) I guess there should be a space for 'grey area' content (meaning content that has opposite opinions from different professionals of the same field). An example would be a venture capitalist saying that is not advisable to invest in a start up that has a married couple as entrepreneurs (I've heard opposing views on this)\r\r5) I guess geographical distinctions would be necessary too ... companies are today operating globally, but acting locally", "user": "30e4cf98e79ad6962ff3c26a70309578", "date": "July 29, 2012, 07:33PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["skills_development_accreditation", "career_planning_discovery", "building_optimism_motivation", "mentorship_networking"], "comment_count": 10, "title": "The collective-work-pedia which erradicates miopia", "evaluations": null, "type": "concept", "id": "the_collective_work_pedia_which_erradicates_miopia", "applause": 2}, "now_is_a_rare_chance_to_do_voluntary_service": {"description": "Longing to be employed makes you depressed?

I totally agree- I think longer-term projects bring out an entirely different skill set than do more commonly-practiced education methods, such as test-taking.

Similar to honors/masters thesis, it would be good to have a dedicate class/curriculum to these projects.

Perhaps once a month, all of the students participating in the program (15-20, say), meet, along with an instructor, where students can demonstrate the progress they've made, perhaps at some point give presentations or make pitches if it's a business-like idea, etc.  I'm just trying to get the benefit of the feedback of others while maintaining the individuality and responsibility that each student feels for his or her own project.  In between these meeting, I think the instructor should be available to answer questions (and potentially address any issues that arise between project buddies).\r\rMy instinct is that a 15-minutes-for-working-on-your-projects approach in the modern classroom is going to lead to not a lot of progress being made.  For me, fifteen minutes of independent study always turned into fifteen minutes of play time and socializing. : )  I definitely hear your concern about implementing any project-based program into the modern curriculum, though.  I feel like at least some time is going to have to be blocked off.  Not sure what the latest research is re: block scheduling, but I know a lot of schools have moved to having longer class periods with the idea that students are better able to focus.  Wish I had some better ideas.  If I come up with something, I'll let you know.\r\rAnother consideration is interim goals.  It can be difficult for students to measure how much progress they're actually making, especially for those on the younger side of the spectrum (but even for college kids).  I think meeting monthly goals (or something along those lines) could keep a cohort on pace.\r\rWhat about some sort of event that opens the year, before people have chosen their projects, that helps them get inspired and decide what they want to do?  Another idea might be to have students get a preview of what it's like the year before they enter into the program.  So, for example, if you start in fifth grade, have fourth graders shadow fifth graders or come to some of the meetings to prep them to come up with their own ideas.\r\rOne of the advantages of targeting kids early on, is that by the time they graduate from highschool they might have done a whole host of diverse projects touching on all sorts of different disciplines (law, engineering, education, business, medicine, etc.).

Around people they really care about or when working on something they enjoy, they open up a lot. \r\rFor recruiters, then, I think the magic is to find out where the introvert's strengths lie through asking them good questions -- asking what inspires them, for instance.

The company and young person both benefit from this. Perhaps this could be connected to a large source of mentors or vice versa (the mentor requesting their company to post an internship).\r\r2. The content consists of videos, podcasts, images, comments, career matching and internship opportunities. Videos and preliminary career matching (unrefined by users) would be acquired from existing databases as mentioned earlier. Podcasts and images would have to come from e.g. setting a recording booth at a careers fair in a university and getting company representatives to make a recording in which they would answer a few questions. Then encourage them to add images and internship opportunities to their profiles which have been set-up for them on the website.\r\r3. Hopefully if there is a bias video then comments would identify the particular areas that need to be looked into. If this question is referring to the career matching system...let me know your thoughts!\r\r4. .

From my experience, this training lasts anything between 1 and 4 months. During this period, the company pays the recruit his / her full salary and benefits. According to my model, since the company involvement with the adopted students starts from the student's first day at University/college, the company gets an indusrty ready employee, who can be put into production from day 1 without any further training. This opportunity cost of training can be a possible source of funding towards tuition fees. Furthermore, many a time, companies hire external consultants to train their new recruits (a common practice in the IT industry, from my experience). The proposed model will also save these consultants fees for the companies which can be channelized towards reimbursing tuition fees.

I think it's a good idea because governments are the ones with great contacts - nationally and internationally - and have the power to create these bigger scale programmes. \r\rI wanted to share with you a program that is quite famous in my home country Portugal, operated by the government and other public institutions called INOV CONTACTO -  http://portugalglobal.pt/PT/InovContacto/Paginas/AboutInovContacto.aspx . It's a 6month paid internship for recent and unemployed graduates in the business or arts fields (you have to be unemployed to apply) and you go through a long process to be accepted (about 3 interviews). You can be sent anywhere around the world, from Spain to China. During the interview process who have no idea where you are going to be sent, and a month before you go you find out the company + country you are going to! Usually you'll do a  1 week trial at the affiliate office in Portugal (if the company has one). Last year for financial reasons the programme didn't happen but this year it has gone ahead again. Unfortunately it's the only programme of its kind in the country, and to be honest favours quite educated individuals, and not often ones who are unemployed AND no univeristy studies, but still, it's a great scheme. I know some people who have participated and remain at their companies now with a full time job.\r\rI think these programmes should become more available and accessible to anyone at the present times, which are particular hard for the younger generation.

The idea of the program is currently structured to be a 2 year program, where the first year will have a strong emphasis on learning. For the first year, I see a great opportunity for supporters to be involved as mentors and advisors, give guest lectures, share case studies, and personal experiences. The first year recent graduates will be working with partnered organizations in the bay area, so this would make it more convenient for supporters to travel.\r\rFor the second year, during recent graduates field work, recent graduates are required to have an interactive blog to document their experiences as a way to share, inspire, and learn. Graduates will face challenges while working on the field, and it would be helpful to address the challenges as they come up to the greater community. The web platform will serve as a medium for supporters and the public community to brain storm, provide resources, and support the recent graduates while they are in the field.\r\rTo strengthen the donor relationship, I had a 1-1 funding model idea. Where a recent graduate is paired up with a donor. Donors can play a crucial role and be involved in the process. \r\rThank you very much for asking hard and important questions!  \rA lot more work to do! .\r\r-Viria ", "user": "2d3e41e4ef31716e29992febecfcbbcf", "date": "August 07, 2012, 05:56PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["job_sampling_internships", "skills_development_accreditation", "building_optimism_motivation", "career_planning_discovery", "mentorship_networking"], "comment_count": 4, "title": "A 2 year fellowship program for recent grads that leads to a life long commitment for social change!", "evaluations": null, "type": "concept", "id": "_a_2_year_fellowship_program_which_wil_lead_to_a_life_long_commitment_for_social_change_", "applause": 18}, "oscar_mauricio_vasquez...._a_history_of_entrepreneurship": {"description": "an article showing the experience of an entrepreneur in Cali colombia.

Mechanisms need to be put in place (e.g. training on what is permissable as feedback, legal disclaimers) so that the companies feel safe enough to proceed with this concept.", "user": "4d45b7bf9d16bfcafcb21bc0ee8885dc", "date": "August 24, 2012, 12:42PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "job_interviews_as_learning_moments", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Congrats on this idea moving on to our Youth Employment Challenge Refinement phase Top 20!\r\rWHAT THE EXPERT PANEL LIKED:\rThis concept has proved popular in terms of community applause and comments  presumably because everyone identifies with the frustration of putting your heart and soul into an interview and coming away with little or no feedback!

Yes, there are two driving factors in my concept. From previous discussions with new grads, I believe there are two major problems that are preventing young adults from finding a fulfilling job. \r\rThe first problem: Many students do not know what type of job they want to pursue. I hoped to mitigate this problem by providing a collection of online videos, which show the inner workings of each profession. These videos may narrow down or reveal options that are aligned with the student's skills, goals, and interests. \r\rThe second problem: students do not have access to mentors or people already in the industry to help them get their foot in the door. Some students may already know where they want to go in their career, but are having a difficult time entering into the industry for whatever reason.

So many students feel cheated, now that they're graduated, that this so-called social compact hasn't paid dividends yet.\r\rWhat this promise fails to account for is that the number of college graduates with good schools, grades, and diplomas is growing every year, while the number of entry-level jobs is most certainly not. Doing the bare minimum will not differentiate applicants from a crowd of hundreds and thousands of fellow graduates who look exactly like on paper. \r\rOf course, we shouldn't encourage every student to start shipping off bits and bobs and teapots because that's the easy answer! Each job seeker's \"solution\" to the job search problem should come from their own individual strategy and be tailored to their desired industry.\r\rYour initiative, moxie, and creative outside-the-box thinking in your job hunt showed that you were a risk-taker, that you had a desire above and beyond book learning to enter the field you were interested in pursuing, that you'd planned your targets carefully and strategically, and that you're capable of follow through on those plans. That's a far stronger narrative than any resume/CV alone. Bravo!\r\rPaper achievements are no proxy for creativity, ingenuity and initiative. We need to train and encourage self-starters. Education and careers cannot be a passive pursuit. Nothing gets handed to us anymore.", "user": "a59d0a948d904b32f0117828995f1c60", "date": "June 14, 2012, 10:29PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "how_a_teapot_and_twitter_got_me_a_job_offer_after_graduating", "applause": 3, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks James for sharing your story! \r\rI applied for Founder's assistant at Twitter.

Unemployment is cyclical, so what happens during a good economy? When there are limited job seekers, a place like this could go out of business. Just something to let bounce around in our heads for a bit. I don't really have a solution, just pointing out something to consider. Some possible ideas to build upon:\r\r1. Let parts of this place get rented out to professional groups like Toastmasters, etc.\r\r2. Host networking or recruiting events for companies, local businesspeople, etc. \r\r3. Have study rooms to rent out, or collaborative spaces available. Check out what people are doing in Lower Manhattan at Hive 55- http://hiveat55.com/   or even http://sunshineny.com/  Its pretty cool, and certain aspects of these types of places could easily be integrated into a youth cafe like you are suggesting.\r\r4. Charge a modest membership fee so that people feel like they are part of a community, and also feel like they have some \"skin in the game\".\r\r4a.

I did what any other hopeful candidate would do: submit a resume, send a cover letter and link to my online portfolio. In-person interviews took place at the company's office, as expected. Both parties involved wanted to learn more about each other. Conveniently, the company involved was hosting a studio open house that upcoming weekend which my interviewer invited me to. The following week, I was invited to swing by the company's office after work hours (they were near where I was working at the time), to catch up and have a few beers with the design team. Days later, I visited their office again and this time went out to lunch with their team. In all instances, I had the opportunity to mingle with my potential future coworkers and boss. I learned more about them, they learned more about me. There is only so much information that can be extracted during a 60 minute interview. \"Blind dates\", whether going out to lunch or casually talking beyond the initial interview, allow both sides to get to know each other better. After all, the employer isn't going to be hiring your resume. They're going to be hiring YOU. It would only make sense then that they should invest more time in knowing you better...and oh yeah, I wound up getting to do consulting work for the company in the end. :)\r\rBefore that company I worked for a smaller design boutique in Chicago. The interview process was standard. We decided we liked each other and wanted to give it a go. However, I didn't come on board full time right away. The company had a practice of \"dating\" you before they \"married\" you. So instead, I worked for the company on-site for a week and was compensated as a freelance designer would be. From that point, job candidates would either continue on with the company or part ways with no hard feelings. This week-long date enabled me to get a real taste of the office culture and get to know who I would be working with. It also confirmed that the company was right for meat which point I continued on with the company. \r\rIn short, I think this is an interesting opportunity area to explore what these blind dates could be like. Where should they take place? Who should be involved? What should take place?

Instead of instituting this initiative as part of the curriculum, perhaps it can be assigned as a project where students can research various industries and then present their findings to the rest of their class, all culminating in a visit by a representative from that industry.

Glad it resonates with you. \r\rSome aspects could and should be included in courses. There is also a change implied at the society level. I remember when I decided to study philosophy.

Maybe I've been lucky, but I don't regret my choice. \r\rIn this case, more than a course, I'm thinking of a tool kit with a series of activities targeted at making people realize that they might have more skills than they think (or different skills).

An activity that I used in one of my courses is to have students ask a certain number of people (about 10) who know them well to describe what they think are these persons strengths. This is often a great learning experience for people.\r\rThe second part would be to make people reflect about what they really want to do: of course, in terms of activities, but also where (in a city or in the countryside, in a big or small company, in the public or private sector)... \rMaybe I should clarify this in my concept.

I think you are identifying a really important problem with youth not knowing what they should be studying in high school and college.  The question is what should determine their course of study? \r\rI think you are suggesting that their career-of-choice is what should mostly drive this decision process.  I would agree.  I myself earned a undergraduate degree that was very practical due to the fact that it qualified me for a wide range of jobs in business and elsewhere, but I knew so many people who didn't know what their passion was, much less where they wanted to work after graduation.  I think it is a shame that so many of us go to school without a career in mind and a motivation (other than being afraid of working at McDonalds) for why we want the higher education.  So many people go to school to get an education because that is what people tell us to do.   To go through university without an appreciation for why the education is valuable seems kind of backwards and not ideal to me.  That is comment #1.\r\rComment #2 is that I think career ambitions should only indirectly drive our curriculum choices.  That is because our intrinsic personalities should drive our career ambitions, and then the career ambitions will guide our curriculum choices.  I think the most critical thing for all of us to do is understand ourselves and our strengths.  In many ways, college helps us discover ourselves and our strengths, but--as someone who discovered his true passions and strengths only after receiving my BA and who has met many such young people who do not know themselves well enough--I think the first and most critical step is true self-discovery.  If we simply give youth the inspiration and means for discovering how they can use their strengths and interests to develop economically valuable skills, they will naturally do so many of the things necessary to successfully pursuing a career.   \r\rI therefore think the best and most effective ideas for ensuring an employable and career-focused generation of youth is to help them understand their own strengths and what kinds jobs would be a good fit for someone with these strengths.  This is simple in concept, but hard to execute, but I think some of the concepts posted in this challenge have tried to identify this as critical first step.  \rOne such concept posted for this challenge is the \"What color is my parachute\" concept:  http://www.openideo.com/open/youth-employment/concepting/what-color-is-your-parachute-find-your-passion-fyp-toolkit/", "user": "8b60951ccf9d95431e946169687d81c3", "date": "August 10, 2012, 02:38AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "what_are_my_options", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "This is a marvelous suggestion.\rWe used to have career counseling within high schools and in primary schools there is some focus on broad occupational areas.\rHere in Australia most of the universities outline the types of occupations and employment opportunities associated with each subject offered but they are just lists with very little detail of the jobs themselves.\rWhen I started university almost 45 years ago the situation was largely the same. Unless you had a passionate idea of what you wanted to be the motivation to pursue study could easily lead to poor results.\r\rThere is a challenge with requiring students to make choices too early in the education process but integrating some aspects of ways in which to apply what is being learned early in schooling is essential.

It also made it incredibly hard for kids who were not great test takers to pursue more rigorous course loads.\r\rWith that said, I do see on the other end of the process friends (who tracked well) emerging from school with a confidence in their abilities and a clear direction and surety in the job hunt.  \r\rHow do we take something of this idea of tracking and infuse greater flexibility in the process and make the focus more on helping kids make the choices rather than pushing them into tracked fields according to how they test?  I think this mobile clinic of sorts might be the first step...\r\rI also am really intrigued by your comment  about how increased urbanization has led to increased detachment among youth.  I think this speaks to human unhappiness when presented with too many choices.  We are overwhelmed with finding the perfect option and end up unhappy with our choice as we inevitably wonder what better decision we could have made.\r\rPerhaps kids in urban settings with infinite job choices find themselves so overwhelmed by choice that it becomes easier to detach.

With one million Gulf War era2 veterans transitioning back to civilian life over the next five years this is a an issue thats needs to be adressed. This demographic represents one of the greatest untapped assets of our country. The young veterans that have served over seas possess unique leadership and communication skills that have been tried and tested under the most austere and hostile conditions. They are mission focused, disciplined and accustomed to life or death team work..... Are these skills not applicable in the private sector? \r\rThe issue: For every solider we loose in Iraq or Afghanistan we loose twenty-five to suicide at a rate of 17 per day. The unemployment rate for male veterans 18 to 24 is 29.1% vs. 17.6% to their civillian cohorts. \r\rOrgs. like IAVA are tremendous and are doing incredible things on the advocacy front but what has not been adressed well and in a holistic manner yet are platforms that adress the issue physically. Overnight veterans loose their structure, community, and mission clarity, and are thrust into an unstructured world they have had very little experience with. Helping them transition to the private sector will not only help them but it will save lives, and ad exponential value to the private sector. It is about bridging a cultural gap and cross training veterans to teach them how their skills are applicable in the private sector and educating private side organizations about the true skills acquired in the military.    \r\rAn org I work with / love that is providing a physical / tangible transition model: \r\rwww.teamrubiconusa.org", "user": "269a82314376d15f4864117ff4cf4115", "date": "June 01, 2012, 03:26PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "from_the_military_to_the_workforce", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Great example looking at an analogous transition!", "user": "884b3f632f6af8e3f87b26795b8a4f31", "date": "May 29, 2012, 10:29PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": [], "comment_count": 2, "title": "IAVA: From the military to the workforce", "evaluations": null, "type": "inspiration", "id": "from_the_military_to_the_workforce", "applause": 5}, "howard_gardner_s_multiple_intelligences": {"description": "Those who don't excel in the three R's are left feeling inadequate and \"stupid.\" But are they really?", "views": 614, "creator": "55396b7895d28d1618bd9e8fa381897f", "url": "http://www.openideo.com/open/youth-employment/inspiration/howard-gardner-s-multiple-intelligences", "image": "http://www.openideo.com/open/youth-employment/inspiration/howard-gardner-s-multiple-intelligences/gallery/multiple_intelligences_diagram.jpeg/", "created": {"py/object": "datetime.datetime", "__reduce__": [{"py/type": "datetime.datetime"}, ["B9wGAwIHAAAAAA=="]]}, "comments": [{"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "howard_gardner_s_multiple_intelligences", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "In my opinion this is an interesting approach. \rNow Questions come to my mind regarding young people who are searching for a job: How can they present their special talents?
