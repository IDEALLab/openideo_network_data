Nice idea. The experience will also help young adults better understand themselves, jump start their thoughts about what they might want to do in the future, and build their confidence in making decisions. As far as the process these kids would go through to develop their pitch it may be helpful to give them a basic framework for pitching their ideas. Surely they could deviate from it, but it may help them determine if their idea is an opportunity and if it addresses a problem, need or desire. When I went back to school to get a masters in HCI I took an elective class called technology entrepreneurship. The final team project included coming up with a viable idea for a start up. We wrote an executive summary and then created and presented the pitch. Our professor suggested we reference some materials from the Garage Technology Ventures website. On their website you can find two pdfs: \"Writing a Compelling Executive Summary\" (http://www.garage.com/resources/writingexecsum.shtml) and \"Perfecting Your Pitch\" (http://www.garage.com/resources/perfectingpitch.shtml). Both were helpful. Creating a short two-page executive summary first was invaluable for developing the pitch. The pitch pdf guides you through building a presentation with all the necessary information (from your executive summary) to get your idea across in only 10 slides. Putting a cap on slide length or pitch time may be something to consider down the line for the pitch review process. Also, if everyone uses a similar format it may help with pitch evaluation. I am sure there are other resources like this out there or custom materials could be developed just for your website idea.

By that I mean, how can we get these lessons to be learnt and enacted by young entrepreneurs? \rJust thinking aloud, one could imagine:\r-having his story shared as well as others e.g. see inspirations about websites with stories of entrepreneurs\r- allowing educational systems to be more multidisciplinary to provide people with knowledge to make connection\r- teach students how to say \"no\"... not an easy thing to do, but nothing is impossible.\retc. \r\rRegarding your point that entrepreneurs never fail, I am not sure I agree. I see your point: entrepreneurs will end up realizing their dream if they really believe in it. However, this implies often failing along the way and knowing how to fail, to be able to recover. \rIn fact, Jobs has not always been successful. I believe he had a feeling of failure when he had to leave Apple (which was not doing great from a business standpoint at that time) in 1985. Yet, he was able to keep going, to found NeXt and eventually come back to Apple. Yet, I think knowing how to fail and to recover is key and Jobs showed he was able to do it, probably because of many of the points you mentioned in your post.\r\rthanks.\r\ral", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "April 01, 2012, 02:35AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "steve_jobs_and_the_rules_of_success", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "hi, I think what we meant by \"Entrepreneurs never fail\" is that they fail but are never failures.

For my innovations class my group and I decided to prototype your idea and perform a short skit illustrating the concept of the cafe evening hours. Here are some changes we made to the foundation of your idea: Instead of incorporating spaces from chains like starbucks, dunkin' donuts, or Tim Horton's, we propose that we invite local businesses to open up there space in the evening. This is keeping with the idea that we want to promote young businesses. Thus, in opening a space for aspiring web entrepreneurs to collaborate and make connections, we give patronage to local \"underdog\" businesses as well. Furthermore, we want to invite guest speakers who can interact with the evening cafe users and give them advice and support. For example, business owners who share stories of success and failure. Perhaps, local lawyers who can provide some basic advice on navigating through the legal boundaries of starting an online business. We intend for these speakers to give their advice and offer their knowledge for free. By providing these services, these speakers spread knowledge of their own business and have the opportunity to administer business cards in the cafe. We do not want to simply limit this opportunity to local coffee shops. Any small/local business in the participating area can apply for the program and become a part of this self sustaining system of web entrepreneur networking and collaboration. We preformed our skit in class and it was very well received.

It could be used in business school classrooms but it should be used in other schools as well (engineering, design, etc.). While reading your concept, I immediately thought of a version of this that could be used in a course. I personally use a couple of simulation, but in particular a great simulation on change management which was developed by one of my colleagues at INSEAD. I have been using it for the last few years in management programs but within an engineering school.\rI could see this game (as it is or an adapted version of it) to be used in class and then debriefed and used as a support to discuss concepts related to entrepreneurship. A great way to support experiential learning. \rI also remember colleagues in marketing that had a course based on a simulation. Students were in teams and had several rounds to play and they met in between with faculty members for coaching sessions. You could also envision something similar for this game: rather than one session, it could be the basis for a whole course.\rI'm sure that with the current interest in entrepreneurship, there will be many schools which would be interested in sponsoring the idea.  \r\rAs regarding the European aspect, it depends on the main aim of the game: if it's to teach specifics about how to start a business, then laws and other regulations matter; but if it's more about developing an understanding of the main mechanisms involved in developing an idea and launching a business, I think the game can be made generic enough that it could work in most countries without modifications.\r\ral", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "April 22, 2012, 04:14AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "launchland_social_gaming_to_provide_seed_funding_and_engage_entrepreneurs", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Tim - Thanks for the simulation ideas.

When a green bubble is clicked on the main flowchart overview a sub flowchart could open up. I agree you would need separate flowcharts. \r\rYou may also need local navigation for those green bubble sections that have multiple green bubbles (For example: The Taxation Responsibilities bubble contains three individual bubbles called Trading Taxes, Income Taxes, and Property Taxes. Wouldn't all apply? At least a user would have to find out.). You may want to guide the user in addressing all three so they don't miss one using the local navigation. \r\rIn general for all flowcharts (or text pages) you may consider including breadcrumb navigation at the bottom/top of each flowchart. This would help a user navigate between each green bubble (on one distinct path after the top bubble called \"What things do I need.\") when an active sub (individual) flowchart is open on the screen. Although this may get fuzzy when things connect horizontally across paths vertical paths. Navigation among the main flowchart overview and the rest of the individual flowcharts would need some more thinking. I would just sketch out a bunch of ideas here, see how they could all connect or not. Consider other standard practice navigational themes. What mental model would the flowchart and its navigation represent?\r\rOnce in the individual flowcharts users could then begin reading and answering the yes / no questions to take them down a path. However, a text only version of the main flowchart overview may be another optional format you could offer. This could mimic more traditional navigation. You may need to sort out what should be more standard practice and what is more flowchart like. \r\rFor each flowchart you could also consider allowing the user to collapse the view of the flow chart to show the same information in a textual version on the same page or vice verse (with possibly a printer friendly option available). Like I mentioned before some people may like the flow chart format and others may not and just prefer text on the page (like the tax software wizard with a numbered and/or/ both labeled progress bar).\r\rOne other idea to consider for the flowchart concept would be to have the next bubble question appear after the user has selected the answer to the previous bubble question (i.e. similar to how some forms show you the next item after a previous one is completed or in MacOS a cursor on a folder that opens up the next folder). An interaction that limits what users see may help to not overwhelm or distract them. This may be especially useful since some content on the flowchart will not apply to users based on their answers. Consider letting them see the whole flow chart at start then once they start down a path everything below that point would not be seen until they answer the next question (or the other idea I mentioned about having future options grayed out until they are chosen). Another idea to consider would be to allow them to click on an option to see a full view of the entire flow chart if they prefer to see everything at once or to just get an overview at any point in the process.\r\rI like this visual flowchart idea, but you should try to test it with some users. It would be best if they don't already know about your idea. Maybe you can make a simple interactive prototype in Axure, Flash or create a basic webpage. This would allow you to get some early feedback on the general flowchart concept. You should let different types of people try your prototype. You could go for the people who are the obvious \"visual\" types and those that may prefer text based research or instruction. You could screen for those that like visual instructions (think Ikea) and those that may prefer text based instructions (any manual with text based steps). I am sure you could think up a few more parameters here. Try for a mix of people based on type of learner, age, gender, occupation, etc. Your test flowchart doesn't even have to be as involved as the same one at the top of this post. You can make a much simpler version in order to gather feedback. What if the flowchart idea needs too much work or maybe it just should be only used for the overview or used only for individual sections. Find out early and then (or at the same time) try out the text based wizard option. It will be interesting to see what you discover! (Sorry all this just poured out of me.

My own Ohio has 88 counties and each county has weird little procedures that, again, can be mysterious to even attorneys from one county over. \r\rAll of this is stupid, inefficient and arguably cruel. \r\rThere isn't any oversight body to help people interact with the law in a simpler way.

In my mind there should be some way for user to be able to get back to previous sections and let them know where they are in the process. The progress bar comes to mind again. I wonder if it could count down the number of sections to come or estimated time to complete. This may not be possible due to all the choices, but some type of indicator would be nice. Therefore, the idea of an overview of some sort interests me or some way to look ahead at a glance. \r\rSome forms of wizard like software make make users wonder where they are going and how long it could take to complete. The past idea with the flowchart being grayed out for sections yet to be completed could also be done in a wizard like atmosphere. It could possibly be done with grayed out tabs. There could also be some way of letting the user look ahead, but still see what they have completed so far. It would be great if the system could save their progress and let them come back to it later as well. These tabs could be very basic and break each section up into even the simplest form of an indicator such as beginning, middle and end. This could also be too simple, but a question count at the top of each of those three tabs could give more information to the user as to how long this may take to complete.\r\rThere is a lot of good brainstorming here.

A bit long comment. \r\rEC wants to advice national governments on tax/voucher incentives: \r\rHere a sense of urgency, linking this concept with helping to slow down the growing unrest in 2nd/3rd/4th city regions in Eastern Europe. \r\rBackground : \rWest-European city regions mostly have a 'valley' focus (health/tech/food/etc). Better to be good in one theme, be a global player, than dwelling in many themes. \r\ra. this made them global players in last decade.\rb. the local gov/people/companies feel recognized by nat. gov. \r\rEast-European city regions don't have this focus. All themes are mostly focussed in the capital city\r\ra. this causes currently fast decline of 2nd/3rd/4th city regions, resulting in economic unrest.\rb. this causes the leaving of companies and students abroad, there is no thematic 'home feeling' in regions.\r\rSolution related to this topic : \rWebentrepreneurs can help city regions to find potential internal and being seen/having tools to go global as a clustered region.\r\rSo why not create a 'campaign', making national governments understand that helping city regions to focus is good for them? And webentrepreneurs in those regions are their ally in moving faster global?\r\r1. give webentrepreneurs taxbreak/voucher if they spend 300 hours a year on helping to get local business go global, a bonus if it is within the regional theme. \r\r2. This would speed up the process of discovering regions of excellence, needed to get 50% EU funding for clustering national themes.\r\r3. would create jobs, attract foreign investors, and so more taxpayers, good for national statistics. \r\rI pleed for incentivizing not only to have more webstartups in EU, but also to understand the role of webentrepreneurs when it comes to industry clusters / city region focus. \r\rEU can really help here, especially in East-EU. \r\rWebentrepreneurs can help slow down the unrest in the city regions. City region online grassroots presence, showing potential, hope for future economics of the region is a great start. This can be a great campaign/ nat. gov consultancy by DAA.

Your proposal fully tackles they need of a safety net. Risk is now: investment-tax reduction.\r2. Volume and structure: you need a relevant number of interested and interesting Start-Ups willing to participate in a structure platform (present ideas, gather feedback, provide reports, etc). Partnering is definitively the faster way but why partnering only with one site?\r\rHere is my input to take it fwd: maybe there is a way on which platforms as such can apply for the tax exemption.

Yes, I think there's a lot of overlap. There could be definitions, for example, of what CMS is, or what a \"tree\" system is, as opposed to a \"windows\" system.

We can also explain the differences between programming languages, along with history and which programmers prefer what.\r\rBut there's a piece of my concept that goes beyond word definitions. It's about the difference between how people think. When you program, you have to get every 0 and 1 correct. One misplaced comma can break the system. It's exacting work. So programmers tend to think in exacting ways - Step 1: Start the sentence with a capital letter. Step 2: Make sure you have a verb in your sentence. Step 3: Make sure you have a noun in your sentence. \r\rIdea people, on the other hand, don't often think in such specifics. They'll just say, \"Write a sentence,\" because to them the capital letter and the noun and the verb are a given. This is where things become lost in translation, with idea people giving an overview and vision and programmers trying to translate that into very, very specific language. Some people can speak in both ways.

It turns out that few people traded in their points, preferring to show off their accumulated  points and badges to other players.\r\rSimilarly, I think this system will be more successful if builds off good will (emotional drivers) first and currency (rational drivers) next. \r\rWith Starter Barter, a designer or technologist may choose to accumulate currency, but only spend a little, since their balance is a reflection of how valued they are in the community.\r\rRather than determining all the rules of the \"marketplace\" upfront, it may be enough just to launch a currency to complement natural generosity and curiosity - and see what happens.

But this is SO RARE (like 1 in 100,000) mainly because it is not a sustainable model. Most start-ups need to be market-minded and should be generating revenue to sustain growth as quickly as possible. This requires innovation in technology, AS WELL AS innovation in distribution channels and revenue streams. For better or worse, the big IT companies, essentially own distribution channels on the web (in that they have amazing amounts of data around them, as well as control - think Google Ad Works) - so most start-ups could definitely benefit from their data and expertise in this area.

Based on my experience as entrepreneur and startup mentor, one of the major reason of failure of seed projects is the lake of technical resource, more precisely the lake of a skilled tech co-founder(s) (engineer). The tech resource is essential to bring the idea into a prototype (or a beta for a website, software, apps). And without a prototype, all other resources (business, marketing, project management ...) remain theoretical and therefore useless.\r\rStartup incubators or accelerators are very efficient to motivate entrepreneurs, they are very efficient to bring business and project management mentorship to entrepreneurs. But they can not provide tech resources as a service, because tech skills are rare and expensive. And most of incubators/accelerators works for free (or nearly for free), with the help of voluntaries. The best they can do is to favor the team-building of complementary co-founders (tech + non-tech skills) by organizing networking events. But once again, tech profiles are rare, and based on my experience, in such startup events, teams have already been built outside of the incubator/accelerator (at their business or engineering school, or just people knew each others before). Therefore, it is very difficult for a single person without tech skills (the majority of people having business idea) to launch a tech-based startup (in IT or any other sector). \r\rConcerning the second point: Why big IT firms?\rBig global companies aspire all the wealth and resources of the planet. It's time for big global company to accept the fact that they have a social responsibility, and taking part of a such program is a way to share their knowledge, know-how and skills with individuals. Offering their support to entrepreneurs is not charity, but a unique opportunity to do something good, to innovate and create wealth together.

The equity stocks should be fairly shared between the Big IT firm and its employees. If it's only the big IT firm that owns the % of equtiy offered, this will demotivate employees, and if it's only the employees that own the % of equtiy offered,  the big IT firm will not accept to allow its employees to take part of the program. For example, the program can establish this rule:  20% of the equity of a future startup will be offered in exchange of work done by a Big IT firm, and the equity offered will be shared 50/50 between the big IT firm and the employees who worked on the project. \r\rThe agreement will indicate that the 20% sweat equity will have to cover the conception, design and development of the web product/service, before and after the incorporation of the startup, from the seed stage (idea to prototype) to the early-stage (from prototype to a market ready product/service). Then, it is the job of the CEO (the entrepreneur who brought the idea) to make the startup live, to build a team and to develop the business. Of course, as shareholder the Big IT could also bring its business support to the startup (but this is not mandatory).  \r\rEven if some big IT employees decide to leave the Big IT firm and to join the startup, it's not a problem, because a part of the startup is owned by the big IT.

That's why I suggested that a 'failed search' approach would be a natural way to collect words and terms not already in the dictionary. \rThe first step for a 'user' will be to use the search function - it should be fairly straightforward to provide a custom response (analogous to custom 404 error pages) and perhaps (as a unique feature) offer to email the definition if the user is prepared to leave their email address. This would make it an educational service - as a ICT trainer I am not an infallible source of information to my clients so I would often have to say \"i don't know, but I will find out and let you know.\"\rWhile such a service might not be entirely unique it would, I believe, be a means of retaining or regaining  users who in the meantime may be forced to look elsewhere.\rIf Founder's Dictionary is to be monetized in some way this would contribute to a win-win situation.\r\rAt the back-end the word would then be added to the 'requested' list which might, as Harry suggests, appear as a sidebar list. It is difficult to know how big the 'requested' list will be at any given time but hopefully sufficiently small to be scanned \"at a glance\". Perhaps the 'failed searches' could provide visitors with a request or contribute option.\r\rAnother possibility might be to include requested terms in the browse lists (suitably highlighted). I guess there is a range of possibilities some or all of which might be incorporated. \r\rAs part of my 'learning experience' in website design and development I have been investigating Google custom searches and it appears relatively easy to create such an item, which could then be offered to any other web-based winning concepts from this challenge to incorporate into their sites, and perhaps more broadly too.\r\rIn my Wordpress based Open IDEATOR Resources prototype site I am creating a descriptive page for Founder's Dictionary linking it directly to the Founder's Dictionary site. As an example in the description I have created a direct link for the definition of Accrual. \rOf course a custom search engine has to be generated at the Founder's Dictionary end but I would be very happy to trial install any custom search on my prototype site, as it will always be experimental in nature.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "May 25, 2012, 01:41AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "founders_dictionary", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for the ideas!

There are so many cases of failure (and success) among startups and their founders. If only new entrepreneurs could tap into this wealth of information! Definitely an important mission that Admitting Failure has undertaken.\r\rA couple things. First, is there any reason not to share successes as well as failures? If we only focus on failure, and all of the different ways we can fail, it seems we may always find some reason NOT to pursue our passion and play it safe. There are plenty of lessons from failure that if you look at another example, with similar conditions, another company succeeded. The key lies in understanding which conditions and decisions were different between the two.\r\rSecond, it's important that entrepreneurs are able to get relevant information efficiently. This could be tricky. There are so many examples out there, it's difficult to know which lessons apply to whom. Sure, there's some industry-specific filters you could apply, but I bet sometimes the most valuable and relevant information for a given innovator will come from a totally unrelated startup. I guess one option would be to filter ideas based on stage of development. In fact maybe it's better to divide one entrepreneur's story into lots of bite-sized parts that apply to specific situations, so an entrepreneur doesn't have to read articles 90% irrelevant to their situation to find the 10% that's relevant. Plus, if they see the 10% first, they will be more likely to care about the other 90%.\r\rEfficient transfer of experience and advice is one of several things we're trying to do with Zaplings.

To me, a huge part of the problem is not the concept, but the term 'failure', which I don't think is that accurate: if you learned something, it's not really a failure. If you built skills or bettered your chances of getting funding for another venture, it's not really a failure.I heard a great story once: an entrepreneur coach gave a talk in China that was translated. Periodically, about 1/4 of the audience would giggle for apparently no reason. Afterwards she discovered that every time she said the word 'failure', it was translated as 'work harder', because of the shame associated with the word failure. Only the bilingual audience members understood the mistranslation, and they thought it was hysterical. So I support failure bootcamps but can we rebrand them to overcome cultural resistance?.

It's important not to underestimate the power of lateral and associative thinking -- so that someone's story from a project completely unlike mine might teach me something, or spark an unexpected idea.  \r\rI also think that there is a temporal aspect to failure.  Depending on when the experience happened relative to the story, the story about it will change.  Put another way, there is \"digested\" failure, which will be people telling stories of a failure and what they learned from it; but there is also possibly an opportunity for people to talk about \"undigested\" failure, allowing someone in the midst of a problem to seek solutions.

Also designers always try to innovate and think about ways to improve a product/service (which is also the reason why probably 'designers' should not be the only founders as otherwise they will never launch a product on the market!).\r\rAt the moment I'm working on my first web start-up, Buddy Bounce, and I can say that, if I wasnt the Founder, I would have never been able to reach the quality the product have today without asking for investment (and a big one).\r\rTo try to make design more affordable, over the past 2 years I also worked as Design Coach with a few start-ups that didnt have design in house.  My experience so far showed me that Designers are really important to help start-ups clarifying their mission, getting to know their customers, innovating within their offering (too often start-ups focus on features rather than benefits) and can also help visualising an idea quickly so that it can be tested in front of potential customers. This speed up the validation process too.\r\rI came up with the idea of 'Design Coaching' as I wanted to help start-up understand the value design can have for their businesses without asking them for a massive investment. Unfortunately start-ups usually try to cut on design, thinking that an un-experienced and un-paid intern could do the job without any support (or that they can do the design themselves!). Also, often start-up founders with no design background believe design is just about colouring suff and that research only means 'quantitative market research' (which I consider a waste of money for a start-up), whilst they don't know how valuable qualitative research methods can be for them to understand their customers and spot opportunities in a really short amount of time. Having Designers as  coaches could help start-up improving their products/services but could also 'teach' them the value and complexity of design (so that they may invest on that as soon as they have the money for it).\r\rIf you are interested in my idea of 'Design Coaching' here is my presentation on that topic: http://www.slideshare.net/giuliapiu/piu-guerra-openservicedesign . At the bottom of the deck you could also see an example of how my coaching with a start-up, Meetphool, helped them to transform a web product with no clear purpose, into something that is speaking to an audience (and the founder of Meetphool did everything on her own, I only guided her for 3 days!)\r\rLooking forward to hearing your comments!", "user": "7bbd90b3f9e89efd1995672bcc68a5d4", "date": "April 03, 2012, 01:20PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "have_a_designer_as_a_founder", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "design coaching sounds very interesting~and I truly agree with having a designer as a founder is necessary~good job", "user": "2ed42562c28e8f500f50f18642a80c51", "date": "April 03, 2012, 06:48PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "have_a_designer_as_a_founder", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Good point, Louise.

I'm co-founder of a startup called Fantasy Shopper and we recently entered our 2nd year. Every startup is of course different, so I'll just write this from my perspective and hopefully that will provide some insights.\r\rHaving a budget plan, moreover a whole business plan, is great in theory, but the reality is that you need to be super lean, agile and reactive, so plans become outdated very fast. \r\rIn my opinion, the only 3 numbers a startup founder needs to think about is burn rate, balance and runway. But these numbers are usually very difficult to predict because they change so frequently due to the roller coaster nature of startup life. \r\rThe only goal should be to keep burn rate as low as possible at all times in order to keep runway as high as possible at all times.\r\rI've read some comments below saying that a budget plan like this would help the potential founder get started, but my view is that it would prevent them from starting because truly starting means opening your laptop and writing a line of code, or speaking to potential customers to test market demand.\r\rOur philosophy at Fantasy Shopper is quite simply \"get shit done\" and if we're not getting shit done, we're basically killing ourselves because we're wasting time.\r\rThe questions written above in Step Number 1 are very easy to answer: \r\rDo you need an office?  No.\rWhere do you want the office?  See first answer.\rHow many team mates do you need in the beginning,  0\r\rFurthermore, writing a budget is effectively listing an acceptable price to pay for any given item/service. But as a startup founder (with an exclusive focus on minimising burn rate) you need to hustle at all times and get everything as cheap as possible. \r\rFor example, if I had previously set a budget of say 1000 for monthly office rent and then found an office for 1000, as someone with a budget, I would consider that an acceptable cost and agree to pay it. \r\rBut, as a hustler, I would always try to pay less regardless of the price and this would likely end up getting me the same office space cheaper and thus reduce the business burn rate and probability of death.\r\rWhen writing a budget, it's so easy to spend money, ala \"I'll need some business cards, and some paper, and a phone line, etc etc\". But this is seriously dangerous because it distorts your direction and subsequently the value of your input. \r\rFor example, if I have \"stationary\" on my budget list, I'd likely also have \"buy some stationary\" on my to do list. I'd then go and spend some money on stationary and think I'd made progress. But in reality, I still didn't have my first line of code.\r\rIn terms of refinement, I have a few suggestions:\r\r- focus the numbers around monthly burn, balance and subsequent runway \r\r- add a hustle function, so for every item entered, the budget shows it as 20% less. Gamify the process to encourage the founder to hustle at every opportunity. \r\r- for every entry, produce a popup saying \"do you REALLY need this?\" if they click yes, produce another popup saying \"if you had enough money to survive for just one more day, would you still buy this?\"\r\r- keep the app as simple as possible in terms of maintenance. Allow users to amend entries at any time, i.e. using an HTML5 multi platform web app.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r", "user": "7319cde19fe665265710a41240eed996", "date": "May 11, 2012, 01:08PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "start_up_wallet", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Chris, wow, thanks for the detailed commentary.

I can clearly understand the mind of a web entrepreneur now, especially when he is the one investing in his own start-up. \r\rFor a minute, I thought it is a different case if the entrepreneur is looking for investors, or applying for funds. However, it is the same..He does need an 'average' start up cost to ask for, so yeah the tool would help him with that. But when he starts the business, he would want to keep the real expenses as minimum as possible, and keep the rest of the money in his wallet for the next month. (Sorry for using super simple terms, I'm a bit new in this:)\r\rI can now see that the concept, as it is now, works only for the preliminary stage of the business, before it starts.\r\rThe nature of the web business allows the entrepreneur in the above illustration, only with a laptop, to actually start his business in a short time. He can get shit done by himself, just like you did, only if he has the necessary skills. Even in that case, spending time/hours on the future business is equal to spending money on it.\r\rBuying stationary is definitely not a vital expense; what if the entrepreneur needs to pay for the website design, coding, etc? He can not start spending money before he knows what 'an average shopping website launched from a home office would cost' \r\rThe concept can address to two different phases:\r\r1. finding an average cost to get a rough idea, even before starting to invest in a business.. (that would be the amount of money ideal to have in the wallet before even starting to spend it) \r\r2. helping the entrepreneur have as less burn rate as possible after starting the business.. (the app would then become the 'virtual finance advisor') I can even see it being linked to a bank account like Paypal and spending money from the wallet during online shopping.\r\rI love getting gamification in the process! And I know that pop ups and saying 'you spent too much money' attitude would chase users away. \r\rHow about 'rewarding' the entrepreneur as he spends less money than expected? \r\rI was wondering, when you started writing a line of code, did you have enough money to survive the month? How did you know about it?\r\rHow do you find out about your monthly burn now?\r\rI need to create a 'minimum viable product' from this concept but do you think you would use a virtual finance advisor if the concept grew bigger into such a tool?

If he tought he needed an office, then it would ask 'is there a coffee shop around you, a hustler would chose work there for now.'\r\rCalculating a average, and then comparing it with the survival amount of money required to for the Start-up might also motivate the entrepreneur to invest in his own business!", "user": "aef124e5213d69dc35733683ab0e10e9", "date": "May 12, 2012, 05:26AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "start_up_wallet", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Chris, I agree with you.

Taking the apparently simple formula of burnrate balance and runway (btw Founder's Dictionary lists 3 definitions for 'runway') from Chris and Joshua's pre-existing capital/personal expenses they are together actually making the case for the Start-Up-Wallet concept.\rHaving entered business (not web-based) under-capitalised and without making some of the necessary budgeting decisions I can attest (painfully) to the desirability of using a tool to estimate initial and ongoing costs.\rChris says no to office and zero team members but I think this is a knee-jerk response. The office is wherever you are working which means you have associated costs (even if they are home based) which should be leveraged against tax. If you can manage everything on your own then perhaps your team is zero but if you are relying on help from family and or friends you need to factor in your support for them.\r\rI can see this concept of yours being at least desirable, if not essential, for start-ups with long-term vision. I suspect that those who appear to have 'got lucky' in the web marketplace have done this (perhaps intuitively). Providing a tool for the rest of us is an extremely useful idea.

Rewarding the user rather than warning like \"hey you've spent so much\" would work much better, and encourage the newbie startupper, who encounters many difficulties and has enough reasons to give up :/ Levels can be applied; first you should be choosing very basic things and then going into further details. Also, for the \"Browse\" menu, those who started up with your Start-up Wallet can upload their own stories to earn points, which can then be used to reward them exclusively. That would foster the startup stories under your Browse menu, and you would not have to look for such examples and try to find out about their startup budget.\r\rTurning the \"hustle mode\" on or off from the beginning has some negatives in my opinion; the hustle mode should never restrict the other more expensive options. Even if I choose to use hustle mode, i might still want a chic office in my city and the cheapest IKEA table in that office :) You should always be giving both options without choice overload, and yes, that is a good way to advertise and keep your website running. This might be helpful about how to direct users to choose the right thing for themselves: http://www.ted.com/talks/sheena_iyengar_choosing_what_to_choose.html\r\rBesides those, the expenses should be categorized into two sub-titles: once-and-that's-it expenses and regular expenses. You will be buying a desk once, but you'll be paying monthly rent for your office. So the startupper must consider if he'll be able to afford the monthly expenses, because the real thing begins after you start your start-up. Will he be able to earn/have/provide enough to keep his business running? You should also consider such little expenses like monthly bills, ground coffee expenses (hehe), and so. Maybe Starbucks or another coffee chain can offer discounts or provide such things and make its advertisement at the same time, cutting off some expenses. \r\rThat idea of yours has a huge potential in terms of advertising and collaboration. Very simple, yet quite helpful. It should not be only for startuppers but also for those who want to move in to a new flat for example.
