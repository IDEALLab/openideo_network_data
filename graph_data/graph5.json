I'll mock up putting the URL in, see how it looks, & will update the idea to make it more accessible.

This can all be captured digitally and when you sign up you can see your very card's own digitial footprint across the city/world.  At the end of the day, it seems like that's the more intersting information than the card itself.

I kind of dred it when that time of the year comes around & I want to get out of the store as soon as possible.  Seems like a better use of the cards would be to have them all sent to one place & have an artist make an art piece out of them, no?

Involving school children in weaving these bracelets increases understanding for the need of donors. After all, today's school children are tomorrow's stem cell donors. The children are taught that the bracelets are woven in three primary colors which have representative meaning:  red (red blood cells and platelets), white (white blood cells), and cream (bone marrow).  Each bracelet has a tiny orange bead to represent Leukemia.  We provide the weaving kits to the schools.  We have grade school students who weave using yarn and junior high and high school students who weave using embroidery thread.

Simplifying the the education gap through the use of these technologies is the best way to conduct outreach in places like the US and other highly technological countries around the world. The idea of an app to accomplish this mission is a logical step toward using the most modern and widely-used resources at hand at this time. These technologies are are still growing and spreading to all corners of the world, they can be the present and the future of these kind of efforts for the social good. This is a great idea, one that can also probably bring in many collaborators, sponsors, and most importantly volunteers, as the vast majority of participants are somehow linked in to the communications revolution.\r\rI am Carola's boyfriend and I am at day 120+ post-transplant for A.L.L., an acute form of leukemia for which there is no guaranteed cure. I have struggled with this illness since 2008, and my first course of treatment were 8 months of high-dose chemotherapy with average 3 week inpatient hospitalizations. I went into complete remission soon enough, but the toll of that much chemotherapy left me weak and sick for many months, to the point where I had to stop my outpatient chemotherapy treatments to control what is known as the Philadelphia Chromosome, a genetic glitch in the leukemia which actually makes prognosis even poorer, with an average long-term survival rate of only 5%. The remission lasted only three months, and a relapse meant only one thing: My only chance at life was a bone marrow transplant. This challenge was compounded  by the fact that I am of mixed Chilean, Polish, Spanish and foreign-born. The chances of finding an unrelated donor match were pretty bleak from the start. My two siblings were also not matches for me. \r\rDespite my brother's efforts at finding a match for me among my cousins in Chile, his trip down there to organize their bone marrow testing did not yield any matches for me. Meanwhile, I was receiving inpatient chemotherapy again to hopefully spark a second complete remission, which is a major challenge once you relapse once. A second remission was achieved, but I spent many many months back on my chemotherapy pill that still made me sick and ineligible for any transplant. After many months of being sick everyday due to the side effects of this drug, my doctor finally agreed to move on to another medication - there are only three - and the first two had been extremely toxic to me. The third drug, Tasigna, was handled much better by my system and it gave me time to regain my strength and much of my health. But the specter of a second relapse was not of matter of if, but when, and my oncologist insisted that if I did nothing the leukemia would return, and I most probably not be able to survive that. My friends at work had also mobilized and conducted bone marrow drives, but at most they were able to recruit around 100 people to get swabbed and be put into the bone marrow registry. This is a lot of people to be sure, but in the realm of genetics and bone marrow matching, their willingness to donate marrow was more an act of solidarity than a real possibility of finding a match for me. But someone out there that also needs a bone marrow may match up with someone in my office, and that is the whole point.\r\rSo, why am I still here? The option of my participation in an experimental study with a half-matched sibling appeared from both City of Hope in Los Angeles and at the Stanford Cancer Center. Lucky for me my sister, although not a very good match ( a decent match is at minimum and 8 of 10, and an excellent match is a 10 of 10), was at least a half-match (5 of 10), and that qualified us to be in the study. I am still an experiment in progress. I received my transplant in November 2010, and after two and a half months of hospitalization I am now attending their outpatient clinic for further care. Although I am not out of the woods yet, I am still here and my new marrow and my body are ever so slowly adjusting to one another. The most important thing is that my immune system is slowly reconstituting itself. My recovery should be complete at about one year after transplant.\r\rI share my story because my transplant could have happened much sooner than it did had there been a faster and more massive donor movement in place. I would have been stronger and less damaged by so much chemotherapy that I received. Others are not so lucky and simply cannot hold out for a transplant as long as I had to. I believe that with these recent technological leaps we need to take advantage of our resources to the fullest. An app that could exponentially increase education and participation and most importantly, speed up the donor process will save lives and find matched donors sooner for many that are doomed otherwise. Mobile technologies are also expanding all over the world and in a nation of past, present, and future immigrants, the need for integrating more and more people into the donor databases is key. It could all start with a simple app, why not this one.

I have actually been thinking about this concept for quite some time myself too.  I am in the software development field and also a recipient of a bone marrow transplant in December '09\r\rA brief story if you don't mind - diagnosed with AML in March '09 and there were no full matches in the registry at all.  My friends and family organized bone marrow drives across the world registering 5,000+ people, raising $50,000+ for partner organizations (DKMS, Gift of Life, Be The Match, etc), and so far have facilitated 3 transplants.  I never found my full match and proceeded with a haplo transplant (half match) from my wonderful sister.  I'm 15 months post transplant now.  In the last year we have formed an organization, 30K Friends Foundation (www.30kfriends.org), aimed at connecting patients with organizations specializing in cancer services, supporting patients and families organize bone marrow drives, and help them navigate the difficult process of finding their perfect match.\r\rWe have been compiling our concepts on how to tackle this important and difficult problem of how to increase the bone marrow registry.

It weaves into our every day lives and the social fabric of who we are and what touch.  \r\rSpecific to the application, I would like to expand on it a bit.  I believe the use of location based services would be a key function.  For example, one feature of the app that could help connect people in need with people who can help would go something like this...\r\rEither the patient, their family, or the hospital registers the patient as someone in need on an online service.  The type of information disclosed to the service is TBD, but one attribute can be location.  Then, as people enter an area/location or \"check-in\" to a location that is near the location of a patient, the app would inform the user about the person in need.  They can be directed on how and where to help, learn about upcoming drives, others in need, etc.  Furthermore, if NMDP or other orgs partner with certain locations, for example restaurants, a person who checked-in to the restaurant and learns of a patient in need could walk up to the hostess and get swabbed on the spot.

Do they pay per person that they sign up? \r\rMaybe if it's more cost effective to register people in large numbers, those who want to put on registration drives could also join forces through this app. Putting on an event or helping to put one on could also be a great follow-up engagement for those that used the app to sign up for the registry.

The cost of creating a point of sale business reply mail kit would be under $1/kit. One of the business's incentives would be that this could enhance a touch point and reduce a small cost that they already have in place: tasting spoons. Unfortunately, it's not free, but there are possibilities for sharing the cost of the kits. For example, perhaps a company established in business reply mail like Netflix in the US or shipping like FedEx would be interested in sponsoring and co-branding the kit. Just like a fundraiser, I think there is an opportunity and a need to think about financial donors as sponsors and business partners.\r2. Perhaps Starbucks could work as well. Customers think about some of their products as a treat to look forward to. Product samples could be paired with the cheek swab kit in a similar way.\r3. Likely, there are contamination risks to swabbing cheeks in a food service establishment. The incentive for the donor to make their donation count is that they're actually helping someone in need and that there is a free thank you ice cream cone for them, if their cheek swab is successful. I would imagine that a small percentage of cheek swabs would be contaminated and perhaps the system could email the person giving them that feedback and encouragement to try again. I believe the majority of people want to help this cause and don't have an incentive to abuse the system.

Then it simply becomes a matter for transport and logistics. When you consider the huge quantities of goods that get moved everyday surely there must be a solution right? Could a company like FedEx arrange transport for free in return for express customs clearance for it's goods? Or could an airline take on the task with the incentive of smaller airport taxes? (They could also partner on other peoples concepts of people registering during long haul travel). \r\rThe best way to keep costs down would be to bring in partners like those I think. Additionally perhaps some of the centralised database tools could be open and free such as google docs? Perhaps Embassies in every country could take on an extended role too?

What resonates with me is that you identified two major barriers to the donation process- fear and misinterpretation. I clearly remember my brother hearing that the donation procedure was equivalent to \"being kicked by a horse\" when in fact it was relatively quick and painless. The parallel to a blood transfusion is an excellent one. \r\rI also like the rebranding strategy that invokes the \"superpower of bone marrow. While we know a great deal about the science of the transplant process, much of it still remains a mystery- especially how it knows where to go and when the transplant takes. Plus, I think of my brother as a \"superhero\" for saving my life. \r\rI do, however, think the images supporting your concept have room for improvement. The leading image simply reinforces the stereotypical image of a cancer patient while ignoring the nuances of the disease or the transplant process. The other images reflect those found in a motivational calendar. Instead, I would visualizing the ease of the process in a photorealistic way. \r\rMoreover, indirectly tying the process of donating bone marrow to that of winning a volleyball match or signing a new client detracts from the value of the act. Stay simple: donating is special but it is also easy. \r\rI would also not limit your audience. A \"hip, clean campaign\" does not necessarily need to preclude other generations- especially when the recipient would benefit from the bone marrow of anyone. \r\rAgain, thank you for submitting the concept. There are some very strong ideas in this proposal that I hope are carried forward. \r\rOn a side note, during the transplant process my nurses told me that recipients of a BMT have been known to take on the characteristics of their donor- from blood type (which is true) to other factors such as hair color and favorite foods. While this may be an old wives tale, my brother and I are now aligned in the types of beer we enjoy- mainly Guinness.  Now thats a true superpower.\r\rLuke", "user": "03cc274b440d668ec952b2eb9719b9f5", "date": "December 09, 2011, 09:55PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "this_isn_t_your_mama_s_bone_marrow_donation_process", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I love this idea, especially the part about renaming \"bone marrow,\" to something less fear-provoking.

It requires strong alliances between bone marrow donation agencies and networks of private corporations to create big enough influence to push for the change from health insurance industry.

Moreover, the teachers could visit childrens homestead home gardening plots, compost plots, seed production plots, and nurseries.\r\rTeachers should describe for students the benefits of organic compost and the use of integrated pest management instead of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Moreover, green non-governmental organizations or green energy extension workers could be invited demonstrate the biogas plants, energy savings stoves and solar energy installation in the community. Form a childrens food growing, food marketing and consuming cooperative and link this cooperative with the farmers cooperatives, food marketing and food selling cooperative in the community.\r\rThe teachers could advise the children to grow vegetables and prepare pizza or other types of food at home from their produced vegetables, poultry, and then bring the food to the school for some occasion (a potluck or food fair). This local fresh organic food produce would add additional vitamins, minerals and enzymes into the diet. There could also be encouragement provided to local community members to make ceramic plates and baskets with the local soil/mud, local plants and link these products to the local market and motivate the people to use them.\r\rAdvise students and parents about the affects of chemical fertilizers, pesticides; danger of fast food/canned food and Trans fats for health in the student and parents gathering sessions. Save rain fall water and use it for irrigation. Food waste can be put in the compost hole. Include community gardens, seed production and preservation and nutritional education as part of the school curriculum.

Excess food intake, carbohydrates, sugar, saturated fats are harmful to health and cause obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. This information could be shared with parents in the parents gathering sessions. Students can debate about how to produce food and preserve seeds. There could be an annual competition among the community children for drawing posters/pictures regarding community food production and food consumption.\r\rOrganize an annual gathering for community food security; lean season food production and marketing. Food producers, food sellers and consumers could all be present in this annual gathering. This could be a tool to organize the community farmers and link them to the food producers, sellers and consumers. Farmers, sellers and consumers could be gathered together where farmers can show their products, meet with buyers and consumers and exchange ideas among them. This gathering could help producers directly know what buyers and consumers prefer.  Create networking among parents/farmers, sellers and consumers.

Moreover, organize annual green food festival fairs with fresh vegetable stalls and organic food stalls. The micro-credit program could help the community green food micro entrepreneurs to develop their business in their local community.  All classes of people irrespective of gender, generation, culture and religion should be involved in this food production and consumption education, local green food businesses. I can design a micro credit project for promoting the local food production and food selling businesses.  \r\rThe idea of using organic fertilizer production leading to organic food production and then balanced diets rich in locally grown foods could be replicated in other elementary schools and adult learning schools.

Picking up on your comment, I wonder if we could fit (without too much brute force!) this idea into the Drangonfly framework?\r\rFocus: We need a measureable goal. I think we could get there with number of lives saved? In a single prison, how many people have a second chance at life because of the actions of this prison community And I cant help but think this goal fits perfectly with incarceration? Just a gut feeling\r\rGrab Attention: Unfortunately, I dont see a way through this without rewards? Is it a stipend in your prisoner account if you do donate? Is it more time outside? Moving to a different prison block? Better job? Prisoners will want to see whats in it for them at this stage.\r\rEngage: It takes one life (perhaps in any prison) to show the significance of donating marrow. Picture of prisoner to left, picture of person saved to the right. Would that person be willing to come to the prison and thank the prisoners? Attach a face to the act of kindness. I think there are a lot of options around engagement.\r\rTake Action: Here, I think we use an old idea. Print/publicize the names of those who did register. I want my name up there I want to others to see my name. But, basically randomization (experiments) would be needed here. Publicity? Competition with other prison? Helping someone in local community? Focusing efforts on children alone?\r\rIll close by saying I see a raging debate right now on prisoner organ donation all over the net. Organs after lethal injection? Cost to harvest organs? Lots of issues. Blood drives are also an issue (tattoos, etc.).  I wonder if bone marrow flies under the radar  no infection, healthy, 18-60?

I offered the comments below in the evaluation template, but thought it might be helpful to have them here as well.\r\rI think there is a difference between donating organs after you're deceased (easier to contemplate because we really don't think too much about it, it appeals to our altruistic nature, and it doesn't require any real effort on our part once we're \"gone\") versus donating stem cells or marrow which involves a real commitment in terms of time and effort. In other words, marrow donation is an \"active\" commitment versus a more passive one. \r\rIn an effort to remove some of the potential barriers / objections to registering, you might consider offering a \"choice\" of the type of stem/marrow donor you'd be. While the default selection for the DMV donor organ program is that any organ or tissue may be used, they do offer the ability to check off a \"donor limitations\" option. \r\rWith the \"Be The Match\" marrow registry, by signing up you are agreeing to donate via PBSC or marrow transplant. While the PBSC donation may be similar to a blood draw (although it is a bit more involved because it requires several days of filgrastim shots prior to the stem cell collection), the marrow transplant requires general anesthesia or regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural) and potentially an overnight hospital stay. It seems like the greater degree of commitment required for a bone marrow donation may give people second thoughts about registering. \r\rWhat if potential donors had the ability to specify they'd be a PBSC donor or a PBSC + Marrow donor. Perhaps as a PBSC donor they indicate they'd be willing to be contacted if a marrow donation was required. (In other words, provide an \"opt-in\" for a marrow donation, rather than automatically agreeing to this more complicated procedure.) It strikes me that people might be more ready--particularly in a DMV environment--to sign up for something similar to a blood donation than they would be to sign up for a donation requiring a surgical procedure. And if its true that 80% of donations are done via PBSC, then you could think of this as serving the majority of the people needing this type of donation. The unknown in this equation is how many people don't register because they would need to commit to donating via either method, and if the option to register for a PBSC donation only would lower the barriers to registering. \r\rApplauded your efforts!", "user": "bcf12d4d5134280be5c69b923a9d8584", "date": "April 14, 2011, 07:25PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "department_of_motor_vehicles_and_marrow", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks so much Gaynelle for your thorough and thoughtful comment!

I was actually thinking of something similar with respect to using location based services.  Something like this...\r\rPatients/families or their care providers (transplant coordinator, social worker, patient navigator, doctor, etc) can add a patient to the list of \"patients in need.\"  The patient would need to give consent.  Need to determine what attributes are supplied to the service, but, location would be required such as zip code or city.  \r\rThen, when a user \"checks-in\" using apps such as foursquare or enters a designated are they would receive a notice on the Why Donor I app announcing a patient in need is in the area.

In addition, if donor centers or (DKMS), donor recruitment orgs or registries (Be The Match, Gift of Life, etc) could partner with strategic locations to have swabs on site the user could literally get swabbed on the spot after completing simple health screening questions using the app.  For example, a restaurant would be trained on swabbing or distributing the swab kit.  This way the user can take immediate action and support the patient in need.  This could be expanded to all types of locations.  \r\rIf I understood correctly from your concept, advertisements and special offers would be provided to users via the app.  This is an important piece as I see this bringing in money from advertisers to pay for the lab and overhead costs.  Also, the app should support financial donations to allow users to contribute monetarily as well as getting swabbed. \r\rThe idea of offering a consultation in person or phone with a health professional is fantastic.

Obviously, people who are registering would not be forced to have a song created for them, so those that had big concerns about privacy could still register without requesting a song.  I think that although the algorithms to create the program to convert DNA into songs might be open/public (but not necessarily), someone would have to have a very specific skill set and the determination to create a program to convert it in the other direction (songs to DNA).

By taking a longitudinal approach (much like other campaigns such as being \"green\" and anti-smoking), the likelihood of sustainable, long-term, societal change regarding donation increases.", "views": 430, "creator": "81bdd23f02be16953b223fbb3f523b62", "url": "http://www.openideo.com/open/how-might-we-increase-the-number-of-bone-marrow-donors-to-help-save-more-lives/concepting/lifelong-branding", "image": "http://www.openideo.com/open/how-might-we-increase-the-number-of-bone-marrow-donors-to-help-save-more-lives/concepting/lifelong-branding/gallery/lifelongbranding.gif/", "created": {"py/object": "datetime.datetime", "__reduce__": [{"py/type": "datetime.datetime"}, ["B9sDEAQfAAAAAA=="]]}, "comments": [], "themes": ["motivate_reward", "demystify"], "comment_count": 0, "title": "Lifelong branding", "evaluations": null, "type": "concept", "id": "lifelong_branding", "applause": 4}, "encourage_and_empower_relatives_and_friends_of_recipients_patients": {"description": "Use recipients/patients network", "views": 377, "creator": "2b4cbc9c1cf9f09bc2c43607f05d5b97", "url": "http://www.openideo.com/open/how-might-we-increase-the-number-of-bone-marrow-donors-to-help-save-more-lives/inspiration/encourage-and-empower-relatives-and-friends-of-recipients-patients", "image": "", "created": {"py/object": "datetime.datetime", "__reduce__": [{"py/type": "datetime.datetime"}, ["B9sCGRMiAAAAAA=="]]}, "comments": [], "themes": ["connect_network"], "comment_count": 0, "title": "Encourage and 'Empower' relatives and friends of recipients/patients", "evaluations": null, "type": "inspiration", "id": "encourage_and_empower_relatives_and_friends_of_recipients_patients", "applause": 4}, "creators_with_cancer_": {"description": "Creators with Cancer is a digital storytelling using video interviews and photography to capture creative people with cancer in order to raise awareness and inspire others online.

First of all, I certainly agree that this should not be a one way street, but the concept is not designed to focus on that.  Rather, it's designed to increase awareness and registration of donors in previously untapped populations.  \rSecondly, aid is very complex.  There are certainly arguments for its harming nationalism, but I would be careful about making blanket statements.  Moreover, I think this is more of a danger with nation sponsored aid groups as opposed to international aid groups which focus on medical treatment, which have often crossed the divide and are less likely to cause concern and in fact are less likely to try to cheat the nation for their own political gains (the very reason such groups are allowed inside nations when other aid is not).  \rAs for need, the challengers themselves pointed to the need in such nations being the most dire.  I think that the need is more known in developed countries, simply because we have better and more diagnoses of cancer and more knowledge that bone marrow transplants would be helpful.  I don't think that this points to less need, simply less awareness of the need.\rI definitely agree that the infrastructure for bone marrow is not necessarily available to the degree it needs to be in such countries.  This is not a reason to not try, rather I see it as a challenge that needs to be addressed in conjunction with this solution to allow it to have actual effect.  I'll definitely think on this piece of it and how we could increase such infrastructure in the countries.  \rAs for the \"bone marrow vampires,\" keep in mind that this is not by any means a forced program, but rather completely voluntary.  Not only that, but local reputations and relationships, as well as experience in dealing with cultural concerns should allow such groups to have a better shot to avoid such labels.  But, I agree this is definitely a concern with any outside aid.  \rI hope that clarifies the concept a bit and addresses your major concerns.  I realize that this idea is not perfect, but when looking to increase bone marrow donation in the context of lesser developed nations, I think we will find it very hard to find such a perfect solution and must settle for what we can. I will continue to think on your concerns and how to modify based on them.", "user": "a1e991dcff2a10a49b8e765d1ea4a0ee", "date": "March 18, 2011, 03:24PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "bones_without_borders", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "The principle of international medical aid organizations is humanitarian aid, isn't it ?\rThat is more or less north helping south, \"rich\" helping \"poor\", asking nothing in exchange.\rWhy not a \"north-south\" exchange ?\rInternational aid harms nationalism : many times we have see countries, local authorities being reluctant in accepting international aid.\rPerhaps it could help to solve that problem, but it could also kill medical aid based on generousity. What medical aid NGO think of this ?\rTo avoid this problem you should insure that alocation of bone marrow between developed and undeveloped countries is fair.\rI think that needs for bone marrow are higher in developped countries than in undeveloped countries, but i'm not completely sure.\rWhat i know is that infrastructure for bone marrow treatments is mainly based in developed countries. And that bone marrow sample hardly survive more than 24 hours : an african marrow donor living in a small village, for example, will have to travel long distance to reach a town or even a country, otherwise he would have no chance to go if it was to receive a treatment.\rYour idea is'nt bad, but you must be very careful, to avoid that medical aid NGO began locally perceived as \"bone marrow vampires\".\rHow to guarantee good level of education / information to avoid local populations being eventually cheated ?\rHow to guarantee a fair exchange between developed and undeveloped countries
