While I'm not an expert, what I know from data visualization and infographics makes me wonder how this is possible. These beautiful infographics that we see are based on data analysis and these are hard to update regularly (let's not say live). It might be possible (as I said I'm not an expert) but I think it will require a lot of resources.\rMaybe an option is to have a team designed the infographics based on the analysis of a certain set of data (provided by the sources you referred to) and then you could may be \"feed\" the system. \rI remember an add for an online bank and they had an interesting data visualization based on customers' feedback.

I think this concept would greatly benefit also with input & perspectives from people that have been involved in problematic situations or have tried to share information about a cause they have been affected by. Like this I could try and understand what it is EXACTLY people share the MOST in these high-risk situations. I need more real insights from the people that are being affected to improve this too. I think I'll do some research on this and try and get closer to people in the unfortunate inside of these problems. \r\rI recently went to see the premier of this documentary here in Stockholm, it was about real stories of people involved in the Arab Uprising, and in the premier night some of the actors ( real people ) were there for a Q&A and it was really interesting:  http://www.zerosilence.org/ It's a beautiful and emotional story. The husband of one of the directors has worked at my school, I could try and ask him some questions and thoughts on this kind of service. \r\rAt this moment, some of the data I see visualize with this service could be:\r- Specific to Region ( like Amanda said in her latest comment above)\r- Specific to Media Usage ( if people are sharing this info via e-mail, mobile (sms) Tweets, Facebook etc)\r- Specific to Words ( e.g. Arab Uprising: Fear; Help; Unlawful etc) \r\rHowever as I said I think this needs some input from someone that has been in a situation like this, do you agree ?\rThe Crowdmap is great, I had mentioned it in my post above your last one, and I think we could definitely deploy it on our website : http://crowdmap.com/ ", "user": "890278307fec5590e0f5982a2de58e38", "date": "October 22, 2011, 01:51PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "an_interactive_infographic_platform_fueled_by_the_whole_network_of_supporters_", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi,\r\ryes, you did mention the crowdmap and I was confirming that it'll be great to use it but my point is that it is a tool that requires you to define (at least from what I understand) what data you want... \r\rI guess you have two options: the first one, which I thought was your original idea - to get data from other platforms and interpret them and visualize them; the second one, to get your own data - if you were to implement crowdmap in your platform.\r\rRegarding talking with people who have been in a situation looking for data, that is indeed (and always :-) ) an excellent idea to take an \"ethnographic\" type of approach.

Definitely important to get insights from these \"users\" as it'll be key to think about the features of your platform. \r\rThis leads me to another question: who would be the main users / audience of this platform?   From you concept description \"To produce and display real-time infographics to improve the communication of a movement's messages and data surrounding them that is being produced all over the world.\" I felt your aim was to increase public awareness, but also provide more specific information to some NGOs and policy makers...

But, let me try and answer ure' questions so this becomes clearer! \r\r1- The Aim: \"To produce and display real-time infographics to improve the communication of a movement's messages and data surrounding being produced all over the world.\" I think I am missing a second aim, which is to inform anyone out there being affected by a movement or problem, with free and understandable data, instead of having to search on news channels about what is going on. This platform would crowd source it for you, from the real people being affected, with real info.  \r\r2- Where does the info come from: For this question I wanted to integrate the other concepts mentioned as I thought they had great potential to partner with this concept. The Crowdmap could be our second partner of info gathering, and maybe focus on TWO types of visual data we offer: 1 from the crowd map, 2. from texts, tweets emails, videos etc being sent in via the other 3 concepts' channels.\r\r3- Who is the audience? (This is how I see it) 1: Someone being affected by a human rights issue; or a friend or family member or someone being affected; who HAVE access to technology to stay up-to date about what is being said about it. For ex ppl being affected by a cause but can't participate in a relevant rally being held, they can accompany the live flow of info coming in, videos, tweets, regional specific info etc. 2: Organizations that combat human rights issues, like NGO's & Policy Makers that you mention, could use this as a tool to access and supervise what current problems are being reported on the 'radar' of this live data feed, that maybe are not appearing in the Media. \r\rI know anonymity is a big issue, as has been discussed in Vincent's Amnesty Observer App, so maybe we could come up with a solution to this that also protects users from 'trolling' like Manuel mentioned above.\r\rWhat do you think? I think I need to redefine the concept a bit further with the great conversations that've been flowing on here!

Thank you for clarifying some of your goals for this concept!  It was very helpful in terms of giving me a brainstorming direction to go in :)\r\rSo, here are my thoughts.  I was looking at the Mashable link that Marnie posted and thought one of the websites held particular promise in terms of addressing some of your goals Ana.\r\rI came at this from the perspective of finding a way to get friends and family affected by detainment a way to stay up-to-date on the most recent news by developing an infographic that would incorporate the different types of immediate data from the 3 different concepts mentioned.\r\rHere is a link to the website you can refer to because I'll be referencing it in order to explain my thoughts (you'll notice I've already programmed in a map):\r\rhttp://www.trulia.com/for_sale/x_map/resale,new_homes_lt/Memphis,TN/\r\rSo, first you'll notice that this map has a very simple Google-maps (ish) interface.  I think this is ideal because of its simplicity and ease of understanding.  If there is location data captured within the data that would be coming in from all 3 concepts, this interface would be ideal because it would allow that location info to be mapped.\r\rIf you refer to the link, where the real estate website has the balloons on the map labeled by price, I think the balloons could be labeled based on the date or time uploaded.  Additionally, you'll notice that if you move your mouse cursor over an individual balloon a street view of the house for sale appears.  In the context of this concept, I see the original posting appearing.  So, in the videos coming from my concept a miniature frame of the video would appear along with the title (much like the information displayed in a YouTube listing.  With a tweet the tweet itself and the author of the tweet's picture and profile link might appear, and so on.  So this map could track all incoming information from the 3 concepts all in on map, and all for one region.\r\rI'd also like to point out that since everything would be based on location information, anything uploaded (i.e., video) should be in the language of that region so there wouldn't be any translation issues.\r\rFinally, what this graphic has that is really neat is the ability to search *within the map*.  (You can see that little checkbox right underneath the location information in the search bar on the left.)  The implications of such a \"search within the map\" feature, would be the ability of family members, say, to search a particular date to try to find information about their loved one.  Or to search a particular source of data, i.e., Twitter.  Or perhaps even as specific as name.  Or maybe they want to narrow it down to headlines so that they can try to follow the most recent news about the protests...\r\rI can see how such a map might have profound implications for family and friends trying to stay on top of the most recent information.  Since I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for, I don't know if this helps, but hopefully it'll at least give you food for thought! :)", "user": "3b6f421e7550395e28e091c5565ac80a", "date": "October 22, 2011, 10:14PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "an_interactive_infographic_platform_fueled_by_the_whole_network_of_supporters_", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Amanda!\rThanks for this SUPER post, with great and rich info !

I was thinking something similar too, using Google Maps API, which is rally simple. What we must not forget though, regarding Map systems is that we could use Crowdmap service by Ushahidi for this which already maps a lot of info for us : http://crowdmap.com/ However i'm not sure it collects videos too but i assume so!

Each political group would get a cluster of circles, one circle for each type of human rights violations.  The size of the circles could be determined by the number of instances of violations.

As you'll hear, the project is simple, clever and based on \raltruism...\rThe box on your roof talks to the boxes of your neighbours' roofs and the roofs down the road, and they form what's called a mesh network. So your neighbours help relay your phone calls out and around the village or through the city or even further if you have some sort of infrastructure linking it long distance, like an internet connection....\r...the whole system uses internet protocols as the underlying mechanism for it to work, so it's just the voices relayed on top \rof that. So as you deploy these mesh networks you also get an internet backbone that can be used for internet traffic as well. We see voice as the killer application because in cases where people are illiterate most people can use and dial a telephone, but maybe the next generation can use it for internet access...\rThis is something that's built from the community level up. It can be very small, as small as two units, connecting a couple of homes in a village, and it can scale up to many thousands of units...\r...one of the things that I think we've got right is handle the ability for local guys to come up to speed, to train and repair. When we did rain on the system we spent about 90% of our time on finding and how to fix it, and we made the thing as simple as we could. Switch it on, put it up in the air, set one number, the phone number of the unit, and then you can start making phone calls.There has been too many projects, well meaning people from the first world who've gone there but with technology that's too complex for local guys to maintain, and we've seen that time and time again. So the trick here is we've tried to come up with something that can grow by itself once we put a tiny amount of initial training in. Now we've incidences in Timor of second or third generation training. So guys that I trained have trained other \rtrainers who are training other people to install the system now.\r\rServal is the name of the second project we're focussing on today, and its founder is also from South Australia, he's Dr Paul Gardner-Stephen, a researcher at Flinders University.Paul Gardner-Stephen: At the moment we are using the wi-fi radio in the phone, so very, very similar to the Mesh Potatoes made by Village Telco. And we simply construct a mesh network from that. So my phone might want to ring your phone and there might be two or three phones along the way in \rbetween, and the call will basically hop across those to your phone at the far end. It doesn't rely on anything other than the phones itself.Antony Funnell: Range is a problem still at the moment, isn't it. How do you get around that, particularly if you are thinking of using this system in a disaster situation? \rPaul Gardner-Stephen: You're quite right, the range with wi-fi is quite limiting and it's something that we are actively working to deal with. We are also looking at, from a more pragmatic end, reusing the radio that is already in a mobile phone that would normally talk to a phone tower on an unlicensed band quite close to the mobile phone frequencies. And that would give us probably something like 20 times or more of the range of wi-fi. So without any phones in between you would probably be able to contact half a kilometre to a kilometre in an urban area, and in open country or in fact in a disaster \rsituation where there is no background interference, the range again can be potentially several times that.\r\rSorry for such a long post - its only a small part of the whole article - I just felt convergence and collaboration on these technologies and things like the drums has huge and exciting potential on which a range of services, including Amnesty initiatives could be built.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "December 01, 2011, 12:21AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "amnesty_international_iii_shift_van_", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "The Serval link was posted in the inspiration phase and the Village Telco link in my concept but here they are again if anyone would like to look at them:\rhttp://www.servalproject.org/\rhttp://villagetelco.org/", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "December 01, 2011, 12:38AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "amnesty_international_iii_shift_van_", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "A couple of other interesting links out of the Serval site:\rA Human Right ( http://ahumanright.org/ )  is a project which believes communication is, indeed, a human right.

It's inspired by the 'I am Precious Bike' ( http://yesiamprecious.com/ ) that together with it's driver, cycled across America to raise money for Livestrong. The bike had an 'on-board device that captured all of it's experiences, combined with a cloud-based system that analyzes those experiences. ' These experiences were outputs such as Tweets about how the bike was so tired, and needed to rest, etc etc. \r\rSo my idea would be: If the Van's journey started in Europe, and it's Aim was to reach Iran for example, we could implement a technology similar to Precious, that would document the Van's journey, how many KM travelled, and share videos of the Amnesty team on board and their preparations for their 1st mission, on a website. (Of course money should be raised prior to it's departure from Europe, with the help of some marketing) The Van could then keep raising money while on the road and while helping the communities in the Middle East. \rI know this might be an expensive idea... but I just like the 'community' kind of feel of raising the funds for the Van, while also raising awareness of the issues it will tackle. \r\rAnne posted a concept about Facebook Groups - I told her that we could use your Van as a vehicle of education and propagating her Facebook Group, and that we could name the VENDING MACHINE + VAN + FACEBOOK GROUP = Shift. aAd include the symbol Jason created as a vehicle to turn them into reality ! \r\rOk thinking pretty huge scale here, but that's what connecting concepts and ideas does to me :) ", "user": "890278307fec5590e0f5982a2de58e38", "date": "October 24, 2011, 04:05PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "amnesty_international_iii_shift_van_", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Ana,\r\rthanks for the support and the ideas. \r\rI like your suggestions on how to concretely implement the collecting process.

However, it seems that the van would have a stronger impact if it was offering more than just information about unlawful detention and collecting stories.

I have looked at the 'Ground Control' site and note their broad range of dishes. I have made a general enquiry of http://www.dishcamo.com on the feasibility of incorporating one of their covers into the superstructure of a van (say a Ford Transit or similar). This could provide both additional weather-proofing and concealment (at least attracting less attention).\r\rI also wondered, with respect to information, if it would be appropriate to use on-board sources of commonly accessed information on hard drive or usb connected storage (I'm sure it could be suitably encrypted if required) - that way the communication overhead could be reduced and bandwidth be conserved for more critical aspects of the operation. Maybe even Amanda's matching database could be deployed locally with overnight updates between vans and/or base-stations.\rIt seems to me there is no urgent imperative to distribute new stories immediately, the time involved in collecting them would probably be greater than adding them to the collection.\r\rA little more controversially the vans might also be used to set up local mesh networks:\r\rhttp://www.openideo.com/open/amnesty/concepting/open-network-mesh-cans-be-on-when-they-turn-off-every-thing-/\r\rhttp://www.openideo.com/open/amnesty/concepting/network-startegically-using-mesh-potato-networking/\r\rThis could be overt or covert, and perhaps only in areas where the van's presence has become accepted. Then the van could be used as a backup hub for connection between the mesh and satellite networks. There are all sorts of possible configurations to suit a range of circumstances.\r\rFinally (for now) I see the technology being suggested to protect 'at risk'  individuals (or similar technology) being used to protect (monitor) van staff, and even the van itself. Any such deployment could be extended to other organisations upholding human rights (Doctors Without Borders, Red Cross etc.)", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "November 18, 2011, 05:23AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "amnesty_international_iii_shift_van_", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Paul for all these ideas.

The wi-fi access I really see as crucial indeed.\r\rWhat comes to mind at this point, for furthering the shift-van:\r- Even before the Shift Van leaves to save a lot of people, I imagine there to be a website ALL about the van and what it is. I know this might pose some danger in letting countries know you might be going through them, like China, but we don't need to say exactly where your going. This could be a nice way to create a campaign to raise funds for the van while it is on the move. Again, I'm still a bit inspired by the Precious bike I told you b4: http://yesiamprecious.com/ If we made it into a nice website where the volunteers and local communities you visit were updating the rest of the world about what you are doing, or at least the people interested in knowing what ure doing, this could be a nice way to start 'talking' about it.\r- You mention the Toyota from the Doctors without borders: another thing I think is a great idea , is to implement Jason's symbol if possible in the van. It would be a great way to combine both, and implement it's symbol into the website too, and make it a recognizable Amnesty project.\r- Maybe some of the artifacts from my Amnesty Vending Machine/Info Hub could now also be available in ure van, such as low tech tools for the community, e.g. film cameras, troches, the A-Z guide u also mention, etc. Next month the van goes buy, the locals could give you back some info they may have recorded themselves (maybe some danger here, depending on the community)\r- And of course we might need to tackle legality issues regarding if we can enter certain countries and localities, as the drivers of the van and the team inside might face life threatening situations from corrupt police to violent demonstrators at times. But I guess that is going into maybe too much detail now!\r\rJust some food for thought here from my side :)\r\rSo exciting with you updates and taking this into Realisation! Congrats.

Though perhaps a bio-fuel generator might be a better choice during the rainy season (if there is one, depending on the region).

Finally, I like the idea of a standardized truck, but I think it would depend on the area in which the truck is operating.  I think the reason Doctor's Without Borders can do that is because they're kind of like the Red Cross, medicine transcends political motives, etc.  While Amnesty is more pro-human-rights and less anti-regime, I think they could easily be perceived as anti-regime by the regime.

But it also would be a very visual and easy way to unite those who are in the same situation if worn in public in a safe area. On the private side I see this as more of a intimate tool: one that says there are others out there in your situation and there is a group of people that cares for your family: something that could be kept in private for remembrance, honor, and education. One thing that is different about the Falling Whistle campaign is the circulation on money in the process. In purchasing a whistle, one is supporting a cause monetarily and makes a very public statement. I wonder if there could be a public extension of a private system where anonymous versions of the necklaces are sold as part of a larger campaign to help sustain the project and support the families.

We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the GPS aspect of our concept for you.   Cell phones are ubiquitous and we are assuming that a detaining does not realize that they are going to be a detainee and are using their cell phone as usual. We realize that the GPS aspect can be used for negative purposes and actually work against detainees.  However, we included the GPS aspect in our concept because it is assumed that your phone is already being used for negative purposes when you are detained. Here are a couple links that illustrate this point: http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/July-August-2003/feature_koerner_julaug03.msp  Also there is a device that can track cell phone locations as listed as a Stingray in a Wall Street Journal Article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904194604576583112723197574.html.  Also network spoofing can be used to track phones and this is done even in Europe as illustrated by http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/london-police-buy-surveillance-tech-to-track-and-spy-on-cell-phone-users/.  Given these issues, why not use the technology then for a positive purpose like the one intended in our concept?

It may sound conspiratorial but it is a reality for many human rights activists worldwide. Also the interest of security for family members. If PACT links human rights activists and their families to a larger community of activists, that in itself can be a security risk.

Additionally, they could set up a set interval of time in which they have to regularly check in.\r\rThe person who is protesting is a bit more difficult to capture. You would need to consider where they are (for example a developed nation or a nation with poor infrastructure), the type of technology they have access to (basic cell phone with no GPS but does have SMS, Internet, etc), and the nature of the government (for example various U.S. municipal governments responding to Occupy Wall Street protests versus Syria responding to protesters). Perhaps in situations where most of the public has access to smart phones, an NGO could host a solution like the one I describe above for NGO employees, but host it for the general public of a particular location. \r\rAnother idea is you could use something like InSTEDD's Nuntium, which is a system that sends and receives messages from Twitter, Skype, email, SMS, and aggregates all this information in one place.

A special button would be pressed to take this photo, the photo would get emailed or tweeted as a predetermined post, with a subject line of \"Help, I've been captured\".  The post would go into a holding queue on an open source server that is replicated in multiple legal jurisdictions. You could set a timeout to between 6 to 24 hours.

All they need to do is put a big button somewhere in their app, the user, would be wise to keep their phone camera available anyway.

My group, \"The A Team\", have a few ideas for you! \r\rFirst, we were thinking that you could have people submit videos in support of your website. They could be in the style of the \"It Gets Better Project\". This project became successful due to the support of celebrities and high-profile people. A few videos can go a long way. Our idea was to make a video that explained unlawful detainment and our personal feelings about the matter. The video can end with information about your website and how people can help. We can even have people read the stories of those who are detained! We thought that this would be a great way to reach out to the viral community.\r\rOur next idea was how you could inform people about submitting a story. We created a format for a F.A.Q page that people can look at that will explain how to stay anonymous and still be heard. This could give them the information and comfort they need to assure them their safety in publishing their stories.\r\rAnother idea we have was a structure for how to collect the information from the families and collect and distribute the donations to the families. First, we propose that the families send their information to a safe third party, Amnesty International, for example, who would then make sure the information was secure, and upload the information on the website for them, so that the information is less likely to be directly traced back to them to preserve anonymity. \rwe;d also use this process as a screening or application process where the family could be somehow evaluated to help deter from freeloaders or fake cases from getting up to collect donations. Some criteria for judgement we thought could be police records, documentation, or missing person reports or simply credibility of story, since these things may not be present in even legitimate cases. \rwe also propose that the money be filtered through OFAC both coming from the donator and going to the family so that there is less chance of the money going to terrorist organizations. the money would also probably be sent through and distributed by amnesty international, for the same reasons of anonymity and safety.\r\rLastly, we thought of ways that you could reach out to the low-tech community. Using the idea of the amnesty van, you have that service go out to communities and allow people to access your site. We could also sell bumper stickers and hand out pamphlets explaining the website's services. \r\rWe have prototypes all of these ideas, and I can post them for you if you are interested!

Regarding the initial connection from the affected family to the site, we thought that it would be important for there to be a local community that the affected person could contact. NGOs around the world should be notified about this Amnesty-affiliated Support Net, and should regularly educate, or at least inform, their local communities or those at risk of being detained about this resource. Regarding the legal aid, we really liked the idea of the pro-bono and volunteer base. In addition, getting support from University Law Schools, or even creating a national club that could have branches at colleges across the nation would be good. This way you can build a support base from young people who really are interested in helping. We also were thinking of what would happen if those who had opposing ideas were to post or comment on the detainees profile. Just like a wiki, we thought it best that each comment can be rated or flagged, and those that have low ratings would be removed. The site would also be run by Amnesty, and in collaboration with each NGO specific to location of the detainee. For those who wanted to help, they could make a user profile and list their abilities and ways they can help. We thought it would be a good idea to have a live chat or at least some personal communication with the managers of the site in order to see where volunteers could best help.

That we, on the one hand, overestimate what it takes to help. And on the other, underestimate the little acts that we are able to do, or perhaps are lacking in a certain imagination of how we can take our knowledge and skill sets, and apply it to the situation/person/cause we empathize with. \r\rI was talking to a friend a few days ago and she mentioned to me that after the earthquake in Qinghai China, she told her friends that she felt a deep desire to do something and contribute somehow, that she needed to just jump on a plane to go there and just do something, whatever it may be. Of course, her friends told her that her thinking is foolish, that she has nothing to contribute when she's there, and that she will only add to the havoc and confusion. I don't know whether that is true or not, but I suppose that does seem logically sound of a presumption to make. \r\rBut that I think is true empathy there, and a desire for action towards it! But what if someone instead of giving that type of comments, made her see that she could channel her energies another way into helping in another manner. My friend works in sales, and she's absolutely great at it. Couldn't she have try to raise funds from friends, from colleagues, and then donate it them to a refutable credible nonprofit organization, or just help spread the word to different platforms, different groups, and bring greater awareness of the to people, and hopefully reach someone that could perhaps contribute in a \"bigger\" way.

First of all, I think that without empathy, people who feel a duty to act, will not act at all.

Abdulrahman Zeitoun, a successful Syrian-born painting contractor, decides to stay in New Orleans and protect his property while his family flees. After the levees break, he uses a small canoe to rescue people, before being arrested by an armed squad and swept powerlessly into a vortex of bureaucratic brutality. When a guard accuses him of being a member of Al Qaeda, he sees that race and culture may explain his predicament. Eggers, compiling his account from interviews, sensibly resists rhetorical grandstanding, letting injustices speak for themselves. His skill is most evident in how closely he involves the reader in Zeitouns thoughts. Thrown into one of a series of wire cages, Zeitoun speculates, with a contractors practicality, that construction of his prison must have begun within a day or so of the hurricane. \r\rthanks!\ral", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "October 01, 2011, 09:22PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "amnesty_needed_at_home", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "When I tell people about this book, I never want to blow where the actual story goes; it kind of starts off as this power-of-the-human-spirit story during Katrina but then gets REALLY crazy.\r\rReading the book and realizing that something like that could happen here to US citizens blew my mind.

Thanks, as always, for your suggestions.  It seems I may not have been clear about certain aspects of my concept, so let me try to clarify.\r\rThe video would not be of the storyteller.  The video would be of their matched, volunteer, English-speaking counterpart.  This volunteer would be using his/her own voice (so no dubbing) but speaking the words of the original storyteller.  As this counterpart would be an English-speaking volunteer of the same age and gender of the original storyteller, I hope that it would give an added dimension to the story in terms of adding a personal element to detainees' stories; without the risk of the detainees having to appear on video themselves. I also think that by using a global community of volunteers, this might help other cultures connect with the story of detainees through having the detainees' story presented by one of their own.  To me this symbolizes a global community who would be there to speak for the detainees so their stories might safely be heard.  (Presumably, if the volunteer is English-speaking and a volunteer, they likely would be videotaping from a safe-zone at least and quite probably from another country or continent entirely!)\r\rTo emphasize, though reading in their own voice, the script the volunteer would be reading would be in the detainee's own (albeit translated) words.\r\rIn addition to the volunteer telling the detainee's story, I would post something completely separate from the video.

This can potentially be a 'dangerous' job for the volunteer to do, representing someone else who is unlawfully detained, and a cause they really support.

I also thought that it could be an organic display.  Meaning that it could change over time as the type of the infographic data changes. I.E. New types of information added. We could start out with something simple to display.  An animation of infographic data and then over time it could evolve. Imagine using this to display a 3D image of a detainee. \r\rYes it could be displayed in cities and in public areas.  I love love the idea of this being outside the HQ of Amnesty or outside the UN. \r\rI also think the cube itself has a meaning and stands for something.  I was trying to find out more information about the meaning, but the sources I was fining on the web were not good for me to quote. ...I am still searching.

By reading your concept and remembering all the others mentioned, I imagine a networked program that creates a support system for these families. I imagine in called something like 'The Shift Power Program', and it would need support from legal identities such as the UN or Unicef, Refugee program responsible, and Amnesty of course. These official bodies could direct us fast enough to these families being affected and most urgently needing a support network. The only thing I see as a slower issue here is finding the right people to help : Where are they? How do we find them ( imagine they are in really secluded villages, where now one speaks their dialect) ? How do we influence them in a positive way ? How can we give them help/support without giving them unrealistic hopes for their personal problems to be resolved too, ex. husband coming back soon ? And how do we keep them 'supported' in our Support Program ? Of course the Van  + Vending machine would help us prolong the support system with little technology, but we would also need monitoring of the family possibly, so someone that would be close to them, a representative, maybe the Van, when it comes once a month? \r\rJust thinking out loud, I think there is great potential in creating a solid support structure around the main concepts you touch on.

I agree with you: the support structure could / should be for not only the wives, but families in general.

It can in some cases even be organizations like Grameen Bank in Bangladesh which are very well connected in rural areas. I have the feeling, but maybe I'm wrong as I don't know the specific contexts and I haven't been in the field, that there are much more informal support structures which could potentially grow if they had some infrastructure and resources. This is what I was referring to by describing this project in Southwark, London, where the council thought that the community members will ask for more experts, \"bodies\" and in fact, they did not seem to need that many more people, but more resources such as a space to meet, internet access, computers... etc. \rYet I agree to make this concept implementable thinking of these issues is crucial.

In the absence of a clear theory of change, you'll probably want to tailor the message to your audience to encourage viral sharing (more details below). \r\rIf you're going to go political, you've already provided a variety of options above. Once you determine what the infographic will be about, you can come up with a coherent and integrated ask. Just some food for thought: Is petitioning government officials the most productive? What would you be asking world leaders to do? Is there a list of countries you'd target and a clear metric for success for your campaign? What would people be donating to if you asked them to donate? What does \"signing on to support\" actually mean? Joining Amnesty?\r\rIf broad cultural awareness is the most important factor to you, people tend to share when the piece of content helps tell a story about themselves to their social networks. Note the most viral campaign ever, the Swedish Hero campaign http://bit.ly/dkLMta; the recent success of http://slaveryfootprint.org/; and self-documenting craze spurred on by sites like http://daytum.com/.\r\rIn this spirit, is there some way you could ask people where they live, how old they are, etc at the beginning, then have the infographic is tailored to them? One example of how this could be made more relevant to me: as a 25 year old  straight caucasian girl from America I'm % less likely to be detained compared to a 25 year old gay Nigerian man? It could be very cool interactive functionality... and sharable!", "user": "9b8148f451829f24328c0e3a0e85e5a0", "date": "November 24, 2011, 04:30PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "_behind_the_bars_a_data_visualization_call_to_action_campaign", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Anna, great job on clarifying your concept and on the prototype.\rI was also thinking that infographics could be used for pamphlets to be distributed to local communities - to educate them on unlawful detention, or to explain them what to do (as an illustrated summary version of Amjad's A-Z guides).

Earlier this year, the then president moved to dissolve parliament, because they refused to cooperate in a corruption inquiry, and did not grant the anti-corruption agency access to the home of a member of parliament. This all happened close to the presidential election, in which the parliament choses the next president. The move was a 'career-suicide' for the president of course, and he did not get reelected.

Would anyone like to help me make a mock up interface to show how the information would be portrayed? I'm not really an interface designer.\r\ral: I wish I could but I could not even do what you did. I think that you did a great job in giving us a feel of how it will look like. \r\r1. What would be important/emotional information that we should tell about a person? How does this change if the person needs to be anonymous?\r\ral: I agree on the weight of making these stories real, rather than anonymous (thanks for the article on psychological numbing). Yet, anonymity as you noted in some cases might be required. I like your options of having a fund for the anonymous. I guess you could also have a section explaining why some families, spouses need anonymity and if well told, this story could make it \"personal\". \r\r2. How should we show this information? A webpage/TV ad/??? Should we show all the spouses or just one?\r\ral: I think having specific stories with just one spouse each time will have more impact. I guess you should have a mix of all of this but this is the job of a media strategist / planner. It depends who is your target audience. You could also use the Shift van (scenario 2) to spread the word and potentially get some donations: http://www.openideo.com/open/amnesty/concepting/amnesty-international-iii-shift-van-/\r\r3. Should I name the program Sponsor a Spouse or Sponsor a family - money will go to the family, but I think family is too broad?\r\ral:  Sponsor a Spouse is stronger and the alliteration is nice. The only limit would be for specific donations for education... but I guess this is still helping the spouse who has to pay for the education of her children. \r\r4. How can we get money to anonymous spouses if they can't tell their story?\r\ral: I like your suggestions of having part of the donations to a specific spouse going to the anonymous spouses. To still make it possible for people to choose, you could have the option to say, \"No I want to sponsor only this spouse\" (however it is unlikely that many people will choose this. Based on research on choice and decision making, it's important to do it this way, rather than the other way round).\rYou could also imagine having the anonymous spouse and you could create a persona with a story inspired by stories of anonymous spouses. You could have an anonymous spouse per country.\r\r5. How can we utilize technology to make this process accessible, anonymous, safe, and reliable?\r\ral: not sure about this one... potentially Lei's concept of distributed network could help.\r\r6. What excites you about this project? How could it be better?\r\ral: I think it's simple and strong. It also reminds people of the implications for the spouses and families. From what I read in many inspirations, this is a real problem (survival when the husband has disappeared) and I think your concept can help tackle it.\r\r7. What questions haven't I asked?\rNot sure... I'll think about it. Yet, I think you've done a great job in refining your concept.

Your mock-up is better than I could do - we still need that talent/skills component to the platform so we can ask particular IDEATOR opinions and assistance.\r\r1. I guess the type of information used to inspire us in this challenge is a good guide. I also think that the stories should be examples (from real life) so that donors are encouraged to sponsor 'any' spouse, rather than 'a particular' spouse. Sponsorship shouldn't be like choosing a puppy for the children for Christmas.\r\r2. For a website I wopuld suggest a rotating presentation so that perhaps stories change between sessions (not every time a potential sponsor changes pages) although the front page could lead to a gallery of stories if people do want to choose on that basis.\rI also think linking the story presented on the website to any advertising campaign (using a story) would provide continuity to encourage sponsorship. Agaib here it would be good to have an IDEATOR with media experience provide input.\r\r3.Sponsor a Spouse - the alliteration and sibilance give the phrase real strength.\r\r4. I think using pseudonyms in the telling of the story would be acceptable. Many sponsors will accept this and indeed allow Amnesty to choose the 'spouse' being sponsored.

Sometimes times we donate money to big organizations (very well respected ones) and we sometimes don't know exactly where that money will be distributed inside the organization. So my point is that it would be nice for the sponsorer to see the journey of the initial donation/sponsoring until it has reached the family/spouse. This could be done through amnesty keeping in touch with the donator, saying something like \"we have received your request Ana, thank you. We will now connect you to a spouse and after that you will be informed exactly where your donation will be applied within the family. Right now, your bank will be sending the money to us in the next few days, once we have received it we will notify you via e-mail.\" This is just an example, and I'm not talking YET about the contact between the spouse and the donator through phone or letters, I am just talking about the journey of the donation to the family/spouse. \r\rThis is just some info I've also researched on for my current project and found it valuable!

It seems that lots of energy goes into protesting unlawful detainment and the struggles of prisoner's families stay hidden. I like that this idea directs attention (and money) to those who are left behind. \r\rI wonder if there is a way to encourage donations over time and maintain interest in the sponsored family? I know that Support a Child campaigns sometimes send donors letters or photos of the children (as you mentioned) to build a personal connection and encourage a long-term relationship. Since anonymity is an important concern here, sponsored families could maybe send something less personal like a short note, a low-cost gift, or a non-identifying photo (of their city, for example), that still assures the donor their money is reaching a family in need.\r\rThis is a particularly important element of the interaction because these families could need very long term support. Unlike Support a Child programs, which end at a certain age, families of detainees may need to be supported indefinitely, as their loved one may never be returned.\r\rWith that in mind, it is worth considering if you want to establish a one donor-one sponsor relationship or if you want the donor to have a more active role in deciding where their funds go. Here are two possible models:\r\rSupport a detainee's family for a year:\rEach donor is assigned a family when they join. The donor can pay the full yearly amount up front, or be reminded to pay each month, and get quarterly (anonymous) updates on their family. At the end of the year, the donor can continue with the same family or pick another. This will maintain interest in families that have been receiving support for a long time, since they will be getting new donors each year. \r\rSupport pools for families of detainees:\rDonors can pick a donation plan (one-time fee of $120, monthly fee of $10, etc.) when they join and read stories of all the families that are supported by the collective fund. They can choose to donate additional funds to specific families if their stories are particularly poignant. For example, families could list opportunities for specific support, like paying for a child's education, or purchasing gifts for holidays, which donors could contribute to (like Kickstarter).

Of course, there are variations in different areas such as allowing households to put their houses on a do not show list, respecting government requests to not photograph military bases as a general rule, and banning/exit of Google Street View from areas with more stringent privacy regulations.\r\rFor the \"Amnesty Observer App\", the anonymous blurring of content could primarily occur at the distribution partner stage (see INTEGRATING WITH/LEVERAGING EMERGING ONLINE DISTRIBUTION subheader of \"My Virtual Team\" updates section).

You are right, the worst thing can happen is arresting BEFORE the data will be stored distributely and removed from local drive.

For example - one hotkey to start sending all un-sent data out and remove them locally, I guess this quick action should be completable even facing a suddent break in and arrest.\r2. To access the first node - I don't quite understand the concept here, maybe you can give me an example :)\r3. The bigger the network... - Based on my understanding, decentralize the network is all about break the huge network into small sub-network. I agree that the bigger the network, the less secure. So it's up to you to decide how big you want your network to be to maintain the security level. \r4. Everything could be blocked in thoes contries - Yes, at least right now it seems like the case. And this concept and a lot of other concepts are trying to make blocking become more and more difficult. As I mentioned, in current Centralized Network hierarchy, power totally belongs to the side who controls the server, owns the data, which in most cases, this is the government/corporate side. And the one of the results is that they can easily block the access, cuz they \"build the path\". To decentralize the network is the process to take the control back to end users, we will own our server, our own data, which means we will have the option to \"build the path\" and \"change the path\" as needed. And the result will be harder and harder for the government to work with corporate to block the access.\r\rHope this will help you guys build your concepts.

Here is the answer based on my own understanding of this decentralized network concept. \rFirst of all, all the data in this network hierarchy is encrypted for sure, and the direct connection between every two nodes has to be two-way authorized. The second key element here is that when we say own your data, it includes own your log file, that's even more critical most of time then just own your files. I will use your example to explain more.\rBob's computer gets seized, the government will be able to access the files only if they know the way Bob accesses the files. Then how can they find out the way Bob accesses the files? The simplest ways are check Bob's browser history/cache, check Bob's IM conversation history, check Bob's FTP connection history, etc. What if Bob's computer does not even store all this LOG FILE? The government will not be able to find any file or any contacts who's working with Bob. And this is \"own your log file\" means. How can Bob do this? It can be as simple as deleting all the local log files every one hour (of course, it might get more complicated when the concept gets really implemented). \rHope this can give you a better idea how this works.

They will refuse even to know who the person is. So, if there is no prove there is no crime. Which is why I thought of a microphone that records at least the first instance of the detention.

This person most coordinate and educate the others.

So, they'll keep each other in sight but not together. At the moment of one arrest, the detainee should push the button that will alert the others , might be by a vibrating feeling and activate the mic on the shoes that will record sound inmediately in the web.

A greater number have been attacked, though not killed after filing applications, in some cases having their information passed to criminals: for example, one man reported being stabbed, beaten with pipes, and attacked with acid outside a local government office.\r\rApparently, according to a Yale University doctoral field experimental study (Leonid Peisakhin and Paul Pinto, 2008), these RTI requests are pretty effective for countering corruption: in this case, slum dwellers being asked for bribes to get new ration cards.

Perhaps, the \"Petitioning through Technology\" concept may also have applicability here: allowing Indian citizens to submit RTI requests (perhaps with an anonymous option?) to a central department (through mobiles, online, RTI centers independent of the local gov, etc.) which then forwards & enforces follow-up on information requests (while excluding identifying information) to local government offices.

Yet, I'm wondering if there would not be a way to make sure that each petition as soon as posted would be available to all, in the \"public domain\".\rAs for related projects, it reminds me of a study I read several years ago on e-government projects in India, aiming to increase efficiency, communication, access but also decrease corruption and bribery.\rOne possible (main) limitation would be the resistance from the Chinese government but also every local actors.\rthanks again.", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "October 19, 2011, 06:12PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "improving_petitioning_through_technology_fighting_black_jails_", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Anne-Laure!

However, there may be large downsides to immediately going with such an approach in China: preference for criticizing in private to respectfully save face, safety of petitioner, use of censorship & sacrificing individuals for overall social harmony, etc.\r\rAt the same time, I agree with you that information sharing is very important, whenever possible.

The point here would be to say that unlawful detentions can take multiple forms but it is still unlawful. \rI'm not sure if this makes sense with what you had in mind but that's how it inspired me :-)", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "October 28, 2011, 03:00AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "is_that_part_of_our_culture", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi al,\r\rApologies for not responding back earlier as I am having some connectivity problems.

Regarding this, it might also be worth developing the website according to WAI ( http://www.w3.org/WAI/ ) meaning that the website is accessible to everyone be it the blind or deaf through specific web coding implementation, so that everyone could cherish from this great concept, if they have a disability or can't read.

I dont think the technology overhead for the mapping is any greater than the overhead for language - it wouldn't be like Google maps but rather a series of intelligent links.\rMy thought about maps was related to access in places like the vans where even with limited common language one person could demonstrate how to navigate from country to region to language for their own background then invite the client to do the same for themselves - almost making a game of it.

Just a thought regarding the literacy issue. \rI'm wondering - just to keep it as low key as possible (and in particular because speech recognition as dragon are not easy to use and require time to train the system), that we could have people in the truck writing the letters (or posting on the platform) for women who might need. From your concept, I understood that it might be in the same country. \r\rAnother idea that could be an extension of this would be to revisit the old role of the scribe in the village. \r\rI personally would disagree on how the phone is much better for expressing emotions and building relationship, and how phone (voice) will allow communication at its full potential. Yet, this is another conversation, an interesting one, but not the focus here. \r\rAnother option is indeed the telephone option - I'm thinking of  the project of Grameen with Telenor in Bangladesh with the telephone ladies in villages. You will still to think of a matching but you could think of ladies calling each other maybe not very often - in particular because of costs - but still the possibility will already be something. It could also create job opportunities and provide meaning to the phone lady. \r\rThe more I think about it, the more I like this concept and I can see how it could be developed.", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "November 01, 2011, 02:33AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "creating_connections_", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks Anne-Laure!\r\rI think having scribes in the van would be an excellent idea.  And you are correct, I would like to have the paired women be as close to each other as possible, in terms of physical distance.  So yes, same country would be what I had in mind, same region would be even better.\r\rI actually agree with you that actual letter-writing can be a wonderful way to express emotion.  The reason I think phones would be a better option is not due to expressing emotion, but being able to exchange messages in a timely manner.  Say the van patrols a certain region, and maybe the roads are really bad (or nonexistent) in that region.  If I need emotional support from my partner, maybe I go write the letter, and send it with the truck.  Maybe it then takes 4 days for  the truck to get to my partner, who writes immediately to respond.  But then, maybe it takes another 4 days for the truck to get back to me.  So, in this circumstance, I may not hear back for a total of 8 days.  Maybe more if the truck breaks down, or there is some other kind of problem.  I think that many of the larger issues of emotional support could be dealt with over that kind of delay, without losing impact.  But, I do think there is something to be said for the immediacy available via phone.\r\rFor instance, maybe I've had a bad day, my kids are being challenging, I'm worried about how I'll pay my bills, the safety of my husband, etc.  Maybe I'm particularly sad or angry or emotional in some other way.  With phone, I think there's something to be said for the ability to immediately reach out to somebody when you're at that low point and immediately get their support and feedback.\r\rThat being said, obviously this is all theoretical, and the overall answer would be that it depends.  It depends on how far the van is traveling.  It depends on the consistency of the equipment.  It depends on the safety of the van as it travels around.  Conversely, it also depends on the consistency of phone service in the area.  The cost of accessing and using phones (as you pointed out).  Many problems could arise with either outlet, which is why I think it's valuable to have both.  That was just my initial reasoning to why I thought phones might be ideal.\r\rThe idea of the telephone ladies is an interesting one!  I think the key with this concept is providing women with as many ways to reach out as possible, so that no matter what means they have access to or even simply prefer, they'll be able to reach the support they need.", "user": "3b6f421e7550395e28e091c5565ac80a", "date": "November 01, 2011, 02:54AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "creating_connections_", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Of course, then again, maybe just expressing the emotion immediately is enough.

Going the email route is probably more versatile and cheaper than the SMS version because you can rotate originating email address far more cheaply than changing phone numbers.\r\rFor a more fail safe version I think you want the system to call you however, not you call the system. So every 24 hours, an email arrives (each day, week or month, from a different origination DNS). The users clicks the link in the email and logs in with a strong password. \r\rEverything is cheaper with the internet version than with the SMS version.

It is necessary create some distinction between users and scenarios as well.  There won't be one idea that suits all the angles of such a tremendously complicated problem.\r\rThe idea concept certainly needs to be polished and better thought in different areas:  \r-  Management:  How to use as less resources as possible while generating as much impact as possible?  i think that helping Amnesty International to solve this problem has a huge symbolic value that a lot of people and institution will be willing to bet on (just for the sake of being involved).  From this assumption, many possibilities become visible:  help on volunteers for management and legal assistance, help from institutions like operators, media, labs and universities, etc, etc.   This takes me to the next point:\r-  Strategic Communication:  strategic in a sense of \"keeping the project hidden from the enemy\" and at the same time strategic on a sense of \"seducing the right people/institutions to get involved\".\r-  from a system perspective, the fact of having to build an online system for this, sets the precedent that other \"online concepts\" should be linked to this idea and integrated into a more robust technological solution, for example, the wiki concept and this concept should be consider as a consolidated effort.  Imaging sending the right information along with every smart alert (a ping that contains the right info in order for people to act).\r-  Security.  Marlon's point about security is very valid, but I can't stop thinking, once the detainee physical phenomena (whether it's about a small or a big organization) has the power to take down a technological structure.  In any case, no technology is perfect, and no system will survive to a human force that has the strength and the intelligence to solve that puzzle (how to take that system down).\r-  User action:  this concept is based on the fact that the human brain reacts unexpectedly during high stress situations.  Making the user generate any sort of action in order to trigger the alert seems to me way more dangerous than using the \"non-action\" strategy (that's my opinion anyway).\r- False alarms.  Marlon is completely right here.  That's the first weakness I saw on this concept.  Yet, with the same systems thinking this problem could be solved.  But that solution couldn't be thought clearly until the concept moved to a more real scenario (too many variables to be considered).

Now when the thief managed to get away with this he tried to unlock the phone which was thankfully pass code locked. Now here is the interesting part. After several wrong attempts at unlocking the phone, the thief was unaware that these false attempts triggered an app which discreetly took his picture through the front camera and emailed it to the phone's owner (my friend). Now that my friend had the picture of the thief, he went to the police and by several means and efforts by the NYPD, the thief was actually captured in a week..! \r\rNow my point here is that this brilliant application still helped the owner even after his phone was stolen. So a possible solution to your concept can be a small program in a phone which sets up a process to switch off the phone. If the owner wants to switch off the phone for personal privacy, he completes the small process (just going through a couple of steps) which only he is aware in order to switch off the phone. In this way no alerts will be sent to anybody. Now, if the phone is switched of by any other person (in this case the official who confiscates your phone) he will switch it off without going through the small 'switching off'  process (as he knows nothing about it) and this will surely trigger all kinds of alerts you proposed.\rThis, according to me, might majorly remove the risk of a false alarm.", "user": "0e9b61ed7d7b30f3db82c5786cf2f1b3", "date": "October 27, 2011, 08:06PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_mobile_witness", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Dear Rathin, I really like your story and thanks for sharing, I suppose that sort of application with some manipulation could meet our purpose\rI think bring some of these text to the main text, some of them are absolutely useful and related  ", "user": "1c68bd27143c48545c24e9b2209f18af", "date": "October 30, 2011, 05:44AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_mobile_witness", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for the acknowledgement.

I'm thinking particularly of China, where it's not uncommon for anyone affiliated with an international human rights organization to be harassed, denied entry or secretly detained him/herself. How could we get something like the Info Hub to make its way into the steppes of Tibet, for example--and stay there?\r\rA stripped-down version that acts solely as a small vending machine might escape the eye of a censorious local government, but there is also the chance of its purpose being diluted when locals use it simply to replace the SIM cards on their phones for below market value.

You mention a great idea, a kind of pop-up easy to build and and easy to get rid of kind of Vending Machine.

So time goes by and if Bob gets detained during his travels, an alert will go off (inactivity on a social network, cell-phone based panic button or any other mechanism that could have been selected beforehand). His family and friends can get contacted that he has been missing and help them initiate the formal process for release. Meanwhile in the background, the Amnesty International system will generate data based on previously stored information that matches the case. It contacts interested people in the \"Support Network\" which includes Volunteers, Lawyers, Members of the Press and even Open IDEO members who can work on a real-time solution customized to Bob's unique situation. Even if a person does not belong to the platform and if they receive information about his or her illegal detainment, this same Support Network can work with the family to provide assistance. Thus, when Bob is released, it will be due to the collective effort of many people who care. And according to the Medici Effect the most effective solutions are born from a group with unique skills and backgrounds.
