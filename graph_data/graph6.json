MoTeCH took the mobile piece of openXdata and coupled it with the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) capabilities of openMRS. This allows for centralized record keeping, and as you were asking, longtitudinal record keeping. That is, all entries are linked to a particular patient.\r\rSo, with MoTeCH you can design forms on the web, register new patients, add further information about each patient and schedule additional reminders.\r\rMoTECH is basically an openMRS module (openMRS uses a module system so you can plug in the functionality you need.) www.openmrs.org\r\rMoTeCH was also designed for maternal mortality so it's current version is centered around pregnancy etc.\r\rMoTeCH and openXdata run on much cheaper phones than what you've identified above. The current implementation of MoTeCH in Ghana is using Nokia 1680s I believe which cost about $35 (in Ghana).  If you want GPS, that's going to take you up to Nokia 2710NE minimum which is ~$150 - it would be interesting to know how much added value the GPS co-ordinates bring. There may be other ways to do the geolocation e.g. pre-map the area and codify all the villages or something.\r\rIn terms of the other functionality that you would need to build out the full system you've described above: \r\r* Doctors identifying at-risk groups - I think would be a very easy addon to existing technology- you just queue-up a list of forms and have doctors log in and review - I think this would be just a couple of weeks of work to implement - really nice idea!  It may be worth talking to the MoTeCH team as I'm pretty sure there system auto-categorizes at-risk pregnancies based on form responses - but I'm not 100%\r\r* Integrating with calendar - nice idea - no idea how feasible this is to do completely automatically but could be a separate app that talks to server but Asha would have to initiate probably.  Maybe Nokia could design some extra features into the builtin calendar program.\r\r* Route plan - just my 2 cents on this one, whilst I think it would be good to monitor this, I think there's a lot of good research that shows that giving people autonomy over their work leads to greater satisfaction and productivity. You definitely want to check that all visits have been done - say for a particular week. But if it were me, I would let the Asha choose how to run her week - she probably knows crazy things that can never be codified - like on the 3rd tuesday of every month, raghu always leaves his herd of cows on the road to the village and the traffic always sucks - or something :D\r\r* Videos with visual instructions - great idea and easy. Starting to look at slightly higher phones - I would say ~$100 to do that. Also, transmitting video over the air is going to be really expensive in terms of bandwidth costs so I would suggest distributing mini sd cards with those on OR having them loaded onto phone during training.\r\r* Ring tone reminders - you know I love ringtones :D\r\r* Vouchers - made me think of the concept which was all about SMS printers, but to be honest a little book of vouchers is probably much cheaper. However, I think this bit needs thinking through a bit for transportation - I'm guessing a random bus driver is not going to accept a voucher that he doesn't know if he'll get reimbursed for. I wonder how lifespring do transportation.\r\rAnyway, hope this is useful.\r\rFeel free to ask more questions.\r\rBird", "user": "8fac924254004c7d9240333ca42693c5", "date": "March 30, 2011, 12:48AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "caregiver_solution_for_midwives", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Krassimira, don't want to over-complicate your concept, but just wanted to point out the possible integration of other important mobile measurement devices (disease testing, ultrasound, etc.) down the line, especially as these devices continue to become cheaper and more portable as evidenced by various posts during the inspiration phase.", "user": "b15ab3f829f0f897fe507ef548741afb", "date": "March 29, 2011, 07:55PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "caregiver_solution_for_midwives", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Sarah, thanks for the great comments.

They would then generate profit by adding a mark-up. It's also possible to rent of mobile phones units (people normally already have a personal SMS card). They can also charge radio batteries (important as the pollution/waste stream from disposible cheap imported batteries is high damaging pristine water aquifiers).\r\rScaling up would be through a micro-shop selling other products and services - with a LED light at night so people could socialize and storytell ;-) \r\rAn option could be to get initial investment costs (of a single PV panel, 12-volt battery and adapters for various mobile phone chargers) paid for through 100% aid funding or mico-loans and then make the group/community cover-off their operating costs (pay for black-board repair after year one, photocoping) and then try to make some extra cash to make it worthwhile for everyone. At a local level, this would perhaps make the project independent, self-reliant and focused on local village networks.\r\rmaternal health education...linked to decentralised self-sustaining micro-economy hub/social space......using clean energy.", "user": "47a223381c14945b298e8fbea23c737f", "date": "April 08, 2011, 03:11PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "community_maternity_education", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for the build!

Props to you both.\r\rCouple of thoughts come to mind:\r\rWoman-to-woman connection: This builds off Veronika's point about new/not-so-new mothers presenting themselves as women who've been through the childbirth and new motherhood experience. This is extremely powerful. In the spirit of leveraging existing networks which you guys have emphasised (fantastic), what if those religious organisations and community networks could be used to build buddy/support groups of mums/mums-to-be? Some countries may already have HCW networks (like Bangladesh, through the nonprofit BRAC, for example), based on their province/district/village etc, and a source of support that is near your home is something many mums-to-be may find handy.\r\rAdoption by mums-to-be: The system currently looks like it would work great once mums-to-be have picked up the book/phone service. Question is, how do you get them to want to pick this up in the first place? Perhaps the previous point about community networks could help - where trusted relationships confer significance to the having of knowledge around maternal health?\r\rForm of media: This thought was triggered by Robyn's point about many families not coming into contact with books as a form of media in the first place. Well, perhaps context-specific elements of a local culture may help -- from what I understand (Bangladeshi's please correct me as needed!), education is hugely respected in Bangladesh culture. What if the connection between education and books (as a medium) could be better made? Might this trigger aspirational motivation to get the books? And if there was an educational element (either in the same book, or in a follow-on book to incentivise mums passing the original book on to mums-to-be), might that drive behaviour to have the books so their kids could access it in future?\r\rJust throwing ideas out there - I am clearly no expert!", "user": "7e02f0421845b26f6aef9569d14a00f6", "date": "April 17, 2011, 12:14AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "mother_mati_2019_s_phone_and_flipbook", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hey,  nobody is an expert here, and I think all of this is a great addition.

It is unclear whether a company like Coca-Cola would really be willing to distribute these Flipbooks for free. Also, to reach more remote villages, it is often informal retailers transporting smaller quantities than large trucks full of crates. Perhaps you can think of ways to engage this informal sector?\r\r- The fees for calling from a mobile phone are quite high in many developing countries. People often prefer to SMS or send \"missed calls\" to page others to call them back because they cannot pay for the talk time themselves. Couldn't the Flipbook audio be loaded onto a SIM card? That way, the mothers don't have to pay for talk time to be able to hear Mother Mati.\r\r- Also, every child birthing experience is slightly different. It can be dangerous to have an automated voice message leading the midwife's every action. Often, the correct action depends on the situation (eg. the position of the baby, how dilated the mother is, etc.). It could be alarming for the mother if the midwife did something contradictory to what Mother Mati is saying during the delivery. Perhaps the Flipbook could be a set of general guidelines listened to before the delivery, and the midwife could be allowed to make decisions as needed in the moment. \r\rGood luck!\rJess", "user": "986367cab041526c6231636304ad25ce", "date": "April 19, 2011, 04:09PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "mother_mati_2019_s_phone_and_flipbook", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for the response!

How will you incentivate women to use your booklet instead of any other? I feel you could take out all the basic info like how to wash hands and really show in depth knowledge on maternal health in very easy to understand drawings.\r- One thing that happens in rural areas is that everybody has a cell phone but with no credit on it. If they ever make a call its because it represents an urgent matter. I don't think they will use their credit calling an \"automated\" message, which might be very bizarre for a rural lady that has never heard a machine telling her what to do.

I haven't had a chance to read all the comments-- but one think you could do is combine the phone and flipbook into a \"talking book\" using Mother Mita's voice so that women who have no literacy can get the information directly from the book. A talking book is one of those books that has pictures on every page and buttons that are associated with the picture (or something along these lines), so women just have to push the button to hear the content. This means you could also have only one version, perhaps-- that is pictorial, low literacy, and has some additional information for women who are literate. I would keep the language to a minimum, in either case, and make sure that there is only one concept per page to ensure greater understanding. \r\rI would also focus on making the phone line a hotline-- I realize you have back-up operators, but I think in most country settings a hotline of some sort could be set-up and talking to a real person is always nicer than a recorded message. But, I agree, that in cases where a hotline isn't cost-effective or for some other reason, a recorded message is better than nothing!\r\rA companion manual that goes with the midwife and includes more technical information (such as information on misoprostol) could also be helpful. Additionally, when you adapt your materials in country, you will need to pilot test it in community groups and use their illustrators, etc... to get the right types of pictorial representation. The community groups can also be utilized to distribute the flipbooks. \r\rThe last thing that I'll add, just to think about, is that most families don't have a book in their home-- any type of book (except maybe the phone book in some limited cases in urban areas). People haven't been exposed to this form of media in the same way that we have. Although this will make it unique, it may also be that a different mode of delivery for a particular community would be more appropriate. Or, it may work better as a job aid for midwives, with a companion community mobilization component that utilizes street drama or radio in combination with the community-level talking book to get the message out.

If you are unsure, please email us with questions.\r\rPower Consumption of Typical Appliances:\r\rSmall TV                               75 watts\rLarge TV                             200 watts\rLaptop PC                             10 watts\rDesktop PC                           75 watts\rStereo                                    20 watts\rCharging a cellphone               5 watts\rHi Effic Desk lamp                 15 watts\r\rAn Explanation of Watts vs. Watt-Hours\r\rWatts is an instantaneous measure of power at any moment in time. Watt-hours is a measure of power over time.\rFor example, if the Pedal-A-Watt is creating 200 watts of power while being pedaled if you pedal for 2 hours, then you have created 400 watt-hours ( 200 watts x 2 hours) of power.\rThis 400 watt-hours would power a 100 watt light bulb for 4 hours, a 200 watt large screen TV for 2 hours and so on.\r\rBy: http://www.econvergence.net/electro.htm", "user": "155a2e9ba2686b27dfccb0ab6b2034ee", "date": "March 22, 2011, 06:04PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "turning_anxiety_into_energy", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I really like this idea, I think it's simple and effective.

Your concept began made me consider how fathers may be encouraged to get involved in promoting safe and proactive maternal health practices even before pregnancy. I believe mobile interactive games could deliver powerful messages of prevention and proactive measures women and men can take to enable a healthy pregnancy, while also clarifying common misconceptions about pre- and post-natal care.  Linking these games to mobile phones that are widely used in many developing countries can increase mens awareness about womens pre- and post-natal health in areas where many women suffer due to a lack of understanding about pregnancy and childbirth.  Integrating public health facts and good practices into entertaining games that males and females can enjoy could lead to meaningful behavioral change. \r\rYour concept made me consider a few more benefits of targeting young men using educational and entertaining interactive mobile games: \r\r-   Games can be locally tailored according to local culture and incorporate  interactive messages contextually adapted for regional needs, religious and social norms and activities. For example, games based on popular sports, such as cricket or football, may attract more users. \r-   Since some young mens immediate reaction to maternal health and pre- and post-natal care may be that its a womens issue, games can incorporate broader public health themes that are interrelated and interdependent. For example, information about nutrition and agriculture, water and sanitation, employment, HIV/AIDS, malaria, climate change, etc. can be incorporated. Oxfam, with its knowledge and networks, is an excellent partner to provide the expertise to make this information meaningful and accurate.\r-   Delivery of maternal health awareness information in the form of  interactive mobile phone games may particularly appeal to a generation of tech-savvy consumers who may be bored or unaffected by traditional public service messaging. \r-   Targeting young people, who may be most vulnerable to maternal death and disability, enables them to become critical agents of change who can transform policies, programming, and culture to reflect their right to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services.\r-   Though this concept was designed with young men in mind, its appeal and influence is expected to be much wider (ie. integrating the edges).   \r\rIf we combined \"9 months of knowing\" with preparatory entertaining and educational interactive games Dads could be informed and involved throughout the process.

And your elaboration definitely makes a clear distinction between withholding essential care from patients, and encouraging participation of patients in their own essential care. \r\rI also agree with the principle of incentives. An interesting thing that happened to a friend of mine: the lady who worked for him - a woman from a rural community, with minimal education - once commented on obtaining a debit-card, so that she can also \"get money\" from the ATM. After a discussion, they discovered that she actually believed that when you have that card, it entitles you to an actual limitless supply of cash. (Much like Paris Hilton's seemingly foolish belief that credit cards connects you to an infininite source of money.) Education breeds what we wrongly label 'common sense'.\r\rMy point? An incentive could help create insight, and educate patients more than merely supplying services to a passive participant. In a situation that goes further than mere pregnancy-training, these moms are exposed to passive education, into the inner workings of a health-care system, and can possibly obtain a new respect for all the resources and infrastructure needed to provide this service\r\rAnother interesting article on the \"hot topic\" of aid: http://www.worldpress.org/Asia/3535.cfm#down", "user": "5839256629cf5612f7ce1af8f6439ff4", "date": "March 01, 2011, 03:09PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "volunteer_mothers_earn_health_care_services", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Ian I agree that it would be ideal to make healthcare free for everyone. However, since nothing is free and has to be paid for by someone, this system could help reduce costs and make care available for more people.  I'm not advocating an \"earn it or receive nothing\" type of plan.\r\rLet me explain a little more. \rI live in a state where a local church has a welfare program that outperforms any other welfare program in the world.  It helps more people with less money and allows people to take responsibility for their own welfare.  In fact, the system works so well that leaders from almost every single developed country have come to see this welfare system in action so they can learn how to improve their own system.  Almost every U.S. president in the last 50 years has also come here to learn from this system.  So what is the big difference?\r\rInstead of just handing out free food to everyone who wants it, the people in need come to the cannery and help can food for a few hours.  Once they are done canning food, they take whatever food home that they need (usually about 1 or 2  weeks worth of food).  This allows them to not only help themselves, but to help others at the same time.  It infuses confidence that they can help themselves and teaches how to work.  It also significantly reduces costs allowing the system to help many more people than it would otherwise.  Almost the entire system is run on volunteers from the community, the church and those receiving welfare.\rWelfare is still available for those who cannot help can food.  In fact, the food is shipped all over the world to people in need.  But for those who are able, the system expects them to come help when possible.  The biggest surprise is how excited people are to \"earn\" food by helping with the canning for themselves and for others. \r\rSorry if I didn't make it more clear in the concept. The volunteer work would be highly encouraged, but not absolutely necessary to receive services.

I wanted to add a comment about the language and phrasing of the questions which mothers are asked to answer.  In the examples, the question is preceded by a factual statement (i.e. Pregnancy increases your change of contracting malaria.  Do you sleep under a mosquito net?).  My first thought looking at the questions was could people who are not sleeping under a net (for example) feel pre-judged before answering the question?  The statement makes it fairly obvious what the \"correct\" answer is.  I think this could have a few different problems.  First, women who figure out the \"correct\" answer might chose yes even if the answer is no, especially if they know that sometime in the future the information is going to be seen by a doctor.  This would first and foremost be a danger to the mother because she might not get appropriate counsel from her healthcare provider.  It could also pose a problem if the answers are going to be complied and used for research purposes- if people are pushed towards one answer or another the data would be invalid.  Another issue that could arise is if a mother feels in any way \"judged\" for her answer, she might be less willing to continue with the program.  \r\rWhat about having the question be short and straightforward, without extraneous information in the first interface (i.e. Do you sleep under a mosquito net?) and then include the factual information in both of the answers, with appropriate corrective advice for a \"No\" answer?  I think especially if one goal is to be able to aggregate the data for use in policy, advocacy, or research, it would be important to have someone familiar with survey design look over the application to make sure there is no bias implicit in the question design.\r\rOverall though, I think you have a fantastic idea that could provide a lot of people with a lot of needed information!

Women will aid fellow women and girls about healthy pregnancy practices, FGM and FI prevention \r5. Women will utilize technological tools for communication to build change from where they are  \r6. Educate men to establish project support \r\rAdditionally, mBaby could serve to make women more aware about opportunities for women and girls. Women and girls that are part of the Healthcare team at organizations like Barefoot College could be part of the change by helping to implement the project. By using this project to utilize the efforts that are already being made, the target demographic will have someone they can relate to.

Very helpful!\r\r@Timothy: I hadn't thought of using the radio - mostly because the concept is based on the idea that a two-way-street helps with the issue of data collection, whereas radio is more of an old-media approach. I do like the idea, though, and think that radio has proven to be a valuable means of broadcast communications in developing countries. (I like the hours-scheme, too!)\r\r@crystal Fascinating! I'd never heard of By Your Side, but it's a fascinating example of a CSR campaign that fits perfectly with the core offering of the business! I also like the fact that they keep their communications to mothers short and sweet - so as not to overwhelm them. \r\r@Siri Thanks! So glad they matched us up. I definitely think a once-a-month mobile check up could be fantastic. The report-back mechanism fits perfectly with this new piece, as it's just one more step in the data-collection process. I also think this might be a good place to involve Community Health Workers (CHWs) which I so far haven't cited in the concept. \r\rIf a woman gives a certain number of incorrect or troubling answers (either to the check-up or the prompts) we could ping a local CHW who could make a house-visit. This way, they can focus their very limited time and resources on the women who need them the most\r\rIn any case, I think we have to keep the answers as simple as possible (if we can keep it close to the y/n format I suggested, great, but we could also incorporate numbers for the more metrics-based questions.\r\r@Maia, @IDEO & @Robyn I think your feedback works well together it could be awesome to provide a way for government and local initiatives to plug into mBaby and provide offers to the mothers for further information and services. For example, if a mother answers \"no\" to \"do you sleep under a mosquito net?\" it could either ping an NGO like the UN Foundation's Nothing But Nets to notify them of the need, or provide instantaneous response to the mother, directing her to call the NGO to get access to the net. If a mother replies \"yes\" to \"Do you ever have cramping pain on one side of your pelvis?\" it could be a sign of ectopic pregnancy, and a follow-up series could be triggered to help narrow down the symptoms and/or put the mother in touch with a CHW to follow up.\r\r@Iybosa I think this could definitely be partnered with house visits, and throughout the presentation, I tried to use the word \"health worker\" instead of \"doctor\" to maintain flexibility in this case. That way, a CHW could visit a woman at home, and she can grant him access to her health records, as well. \r\r@Marie and @Joe - I definitely like the concept of a group chat. The reason I tried to keep the concept simple (y/n answers, less interactivity) was to ensure that the program was scalable. I think group chats would have to be mediated by a CHW to ensure that women are getting access to good information. This additional functionality could be released a partner piece that could link women serviced by the same CHW in a locale - probably to great success, as it would help build community and relationships among pregnant mothers.

The community aspect of having a local woman administer the booklet library is great. It becomes a community effort and gets everyone involved. \r\rIt reminded me of a recent article posted on Next Billion with a similar strategy. To confront the condition of low-income women in under-developed areas with little access to education in health, nutrition and agriculture and taking into account that many of these women are illiterate, \"Co-Op Audio\" by Both Your Hands was created. Its aim - it's in its beginning stages - is to educate women on issues that they have expressed interest in and that they will benefit from.\r\rThe idea: a local woman travels to an internet caf with a donated educationally-equipped MP3 player to download educational MP3 files, which are then shared among the women in the respective community. \r\rThe program has been piloted in two Ugandan villages with positive results: empowering women and increasing awareness and involvement outside the community - the youth around the world get involved by collecting MP3 players for Co-Op Audio.\r\rBoth programs are on to something special. If interested in learning more on this initiative and getting in touch with the Deborah Naybor, the director of Both Your Hands, I have included the link below.\r\rhttp://www.nextbillion.net/blog/2011/04/21/from-unite-for-site-hearing-the-pitch-\r\rBest,\r\rAsaia", "user": "aa9cfaf5d5b773e38ecf035a99c88a32", "date": "April 25, 2011, 08:57PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_full_story_booklet_audio_phone_service", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I think this might be one of the most cost effective concepts by addressing the lack of health care information problem.

I have worked on a few hotline projects throughout Africa and Latin America and have a couple of things you might want to consider. (1) For rural/remote areas, one thing we have seen is the issue of privacy (in my case it is for reproductive health information/contraception, etc..) - in some remote areas in Nigeria women buy time on a community phone; in cases where midwives or doula's have to follow-up with a caller-- there are issues with other community members finding out about the content of the call. One idea we've had is to have a messaging system for these remote areas where callers would receive a special passcode and could receive private messages with out fear that others could access this information (the same idea could be applied to a family phone too, I suppose). (2) To make the concept even more feasiblewhy not have volunteers be trained community members? If you have a standard set of questions that are typically asked by callers, community members can be trained to provide information and direct women to services; this need not be just midwives and doulas. Rather, you could probably limit the number of professional midwives needed by having a midwife on call to deal with questions that are beyond the hotline operators ability or if there are more in-depth clinical questions.", "user": "5985a2173f02d421f866c74433afbb2c", "date": "March 27, 2011, 06:49PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "free_midwife_hotline", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Avi, this is a really clever idea, and it can be done.\rR&E", "user": "22dd57cf9796cd7fa1b68603ad5a6f7e", "date": "March 21, 2011, 10:05PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "free_midwife_hotline", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Avi, Lokarpit looks like a well thought out technology. 2 things about it I just wanted to point out that aren't immediately obvious: 1) questioners can automatically recieve automated reply messages/calls at the time of their choosing, 2) answerers can choose to reuse previously recorded answers for commonly repeated questions.", "user": "b15ab3f829f0f897fe507ef548741afb", "date": "February 26, 2011, 03:27PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "free_midwife_hotline", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I think our ideas can work together really well!", "user": "8d2f4a6e4def40216f32ca50eb795663", "date": "February 25, 2011, 05:12PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "free_midwife_hotline", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Wow Avi  the mp3 file really helps paint the picture of how engaging this could be.", "user": "0ebfe65ca16ea82675e4294e27747639", "date": "February 22, 2011, 04:10PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["knowledge_hubs_education", "local_healthcare", "mum_2_mum", "personal_tracking_diagnostics", "lifelines"], "comment_count": 12, "title": "Free Midwife Hotline", "evaluations": [{"py/tuple": ["Does this concept have the potential to save lives related to maternal health in the poorest and most marginalized communities?", [{"py/tuple": ["A great deal of potential", 46.6666666667]}, {"py/tuple": ["Some potential", 46.6666666667]}, {"py/tuple": ["Not a lot of potential", 6.66666666667]}]]}, {"py/tuple": ["How realizable do you think this concept can be?

There was a discussion about this on the ict4chw google group a while back - http://groups.google.com/group/ict4chw/browse_frm/thread/766d5515be5740e1 \rsome interesting perspectives were shared. Below is a copy&paste of the discussion round-up from Isaac Holeman (also available on the google group thread)\r\r***\rHi Everyone, \rEveryone is welcome to continue posting, but this seems like a good \rtime to wrap this discussion up by summarizing a few points and \rthanking everyone for participating. 32 posts is definitely more than \rI was expecting! \r- Reverse billing, short codes etc are possible, and usually the best \roption if your project is large and you have staff who can make a good \rbusiness pitch to the local telcos. \r- Smaller projects, those that need to get up and running quickly, or \rproject that lacks the savvy to pitch to/negotiate with a telecom will \rusually want to reimburse their health workers manually. The key to \rsuccess here may be in creating proper incentive structures. For \rexample, allowing some extra airtime for personal use, making airtime \ra collective resource so that peers in the community enforce prudent \rairtime use, \r- To \"reimburse manually\" could mean handing out paper scratch-off \rairtime vouchers, sending airtime directly from facility SIM to CHW \rSIM, distributing voucher pins via SMS, or having a telco or kiosk \rvender send out airtime for you. The most appropriate method may \rdepend on your incentive structure. \r- There are also technical hacks - for example only buying data \rbundles among CHWs who don't use data, getting smart phones that can \rrestrict which numbers may be called/SMSed, or working with a telco to \rrestrict sms/voice/gprs services and outgoing numbers (the reality may \rnot live up to the expectation with some telcos). \r- Long term, I'm excited to continue conversations about working with \rindividual telcos and the GSMA 'union' to make available the services \rthat will be most useful to us. Based on the broad issues we're \rdiscussing here I think there is a profit incentive for telcos to \roffer these services. Eduardo offered some useful insight on how to go \rabout making the pitch to various telcos. \rI've recorded a some of this on my blog for any who are interested. \rhttp://www.isaacholeman.org/2010/managing-airtime-with-community-heal... \rcheers \rIsaac \r*****", "user": "8fac924254004c7d9240333ca42693c5", "date": "March 15, 2011, 10:52PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["local_healthcare", "personal_tracking_diagnostics", "local_healthcare"], "comment_count": 2, "title": "SMS Inputs Provide Actionable Data for Design", "evaluations": null, "type": "concept", "id": "sms_inputs_provide_actionable_data_for_design", "applause": 2}, "doctors_band_reality_show": {"description": "Music can attract people and gathering a community in just one place.

They go door-to-door to personally talk to the women and their family members to convince them to join the free maternity camp. The aid backpackers should have a fairly good idea how many people to expect during such a camp, so that proper place could be found and proper preparation could be done. 2) the aid backpackers help together with midwives and HCWs registering the women during the camp, perform vital size measurements. (In my original concept I suggest using Nokia Data Gathering for collecting the data, you suggest a smart phone app.  3) Once the camp is over (my idea is a one-day camp), the aid backpackers work together with the midwives from the community on the follow-ups- revisits, finding emergencies, notifying midwives for upcoming deliveries in the community.

Or: When you smoke, the tiny thing inside you is smoking\rwith you and imagine what that's doing.  Or: Eating dark green\rvegetables can help unborn babies be healthier newborns.\r\rRural Health Care:\rAnother game could involve arranging transportation for rural\rvillagers to come to more centrally located clinics.  A \"ride\"\rservice might be arranged, but taking care for safety\rconsiderations and mores regarding women traveling alone in\rvarious regions.  If the pregnant woman is tracked as making it\rto a clinic, from where the health care provider sends a coded\rtext on his own cell phone to verify the visit, then all the\rpeople who texted along the way as helping get a reward.\r\rPatient Identification:\rThere could be rewards for people/cellphone user groups who\rhelp the program identify pregnant women and help track them\rthrough labor to delivery.  This could leverage the user groups\rand village dynamics that otherwise might not put as much\reffort into helping a pregnant woman.  Users would be sent\rperiodic message about what benefits pregnant women and asked\rto text back responses, such as what the woman needs or how the\rpregnancy is progressing.  As self-reporting, this program\rdoesn't lend itself to rewards.\r\rPatient Followup:\rQuestions about progress of a patient can be sent to the\rcellphone that identified her.   Photos and video captured on\rcellphones is now increasingly possible to use in\rtelemedicine.  If there are issues that may be helped with\rphotos and the cell phone is enabled for photography, the\rsender of the photograph of the woman might get several free\rphoto text messages as a reward or compensation.\r\rMothers Supporting Mothers:\rCellphone identification and self-identification of pregnant\rmothers can be used to help establish support groups - virtual\ror phone-based.  New mothers or mothers with a history of\rproblem pregnancy might benefit most from such support.\r\rWho are the different users in this system?\r* communal/shared cell phone users\r* cell phone users who are neighbors, friends, coworkers, and\rof course family of pregnant women\r* pregnant women and new mothers themselves\r\rWhat are the different moments in the game?\r* when a woman is first aware of being pregnant\r* when cell phone users share information about improving\rmaternal health in the community or with a specific woman\r* when pregnant women, or possibly women with prior problem\rpregnancies (putting their next pregnancy in the risky class)\rwho are expecting to become pregnant, find each other and\rdevelop mutual support\r* when a pregnant woman is able to enlist help in getting to a\rclinic\r* when rewards are issued by cell carriers or NGOs to\rparticipants", "user": "1bdfe20c8fe1f7c9bad9ffc09fd3ef31", "date": "March 29, 2011, 06:26PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "make_it_a_game", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "The Harlem Children's Zone could be a great partner here.

A virtual diagnostic survey would be a perfect solution  low cost and scalable.\r\rIn addition to the voice system you suggest, I think an SMS system would work, too.  Due to the number of languages spoken in any one developing country (especially in Africa), SMS would allow the women to find someone to translate the questions into the language of their choice  and would also give them more time to understand and answer each one correctly. \r\rAdditionally, I think the system could work in two ways: either the women call in when they feel like something is wrong or the system calls/SMSs them once a month as a routine mobile checkup.  Personally, I would vote for the latter.  Because health issues are so common in the developing world, many women dont realize they have a problem until its too late.  In fact, a clinic I visited in Kenya told me that many women dont realize theyre pregnant until their second trimester because missed periods and bloated bellies are so common due to malnutrition and stomach bugs.", "user": "fb3f773ef315503137c46aa46b98ddb4", "date": "March 14, 2011, 11:20AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "self_diagnosing_phone_service", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "This is a great concept in it's simplicity and effectiveness.
