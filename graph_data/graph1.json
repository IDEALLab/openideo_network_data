Our nutritious, convenient and yummy meals are designed to be one part of the solution to healthier and happier kids.

I think it would be a bummer if we wasted more food than we already do.Also something to think about are the foods that don't require a utensil such as burgers and fries.  But I guess then the fork could be used more as a probe.What if your concept was applied to utensils used during the preparation stage?  Such as in a mixing spoon.  Or what if your pots and pans had handles that showed 'X's and 'O's on them depending on the ingredients that were being prepared in them?  If my pan handle started flashing with a red 'X' it might prompt me to make sure there is a higher proportion of vegetables to oil in the pan as I am making the dish.

Working, stressed, parents, who don't have time and energy to be concerned about making healthy cooking a part of their lives (compared to the concerns of money which is much more immediate) - because they simply don't have time or mind space for it. \nWhen I've had a bad day, which seems to be most days - I want to come home and pass out of the sofa - the first thing I think of is wine, take-out and mind numbing TV. It's easy. It's less stress. It's relatively cheap (I can't make a single meal for the same price they would charge for a burger -  economy of scale and bulk).  It's win win win on face value - and when I'm tired and beaten, face value is really all that matters.\nCoupled with that - more than a century of advertising, engineered flavors, fun - youth targeted experiences and a place you can take attention starved kids to simply get rid of them and have them play in a safe environment = short sighted but immediate solution.  The spiral continues.\nTo me, the problem goes a lot wider than food.  It's fighting 50 years of culture. It's about parents not being able to cope with the strain of kids - and this might be due to kids not being active, playing outside [it's not safe anymore and we are all paranoid of movie-like horrible things waiting out there in the world, so McD's, video games and TV sounds safer). It's fighting parents' modern lifestyles - of which economy and perception plays a part.It's like fighting the tobacco industry - because no corporation is going to sit back and see they're fast-food profits disappear without a fight.  It's most likely the culmination of at least 3 generations of slow paradigm shifting towards faster, easier, societal value systems (like health vs wealth) etc.  \nIf I was a philosopher, I would have said that it will take large scale visible degradation, actual children dying daily and 50 years of seeing the results of our ways before minds start to change.  not just the enlightened few who watch TED. Look at HIV AIDS - what it took for people to notice - and to what extent the greater society actually cares about it (as long as it doesn't happen to me).  Education is always the better option - and it's been first on the list to solve almost any wrong in the world... but I'm starting to think it's overrated - simply because it's too slow and resource intensive.  Luckily I'm a designer and not a philosopher - so I'm eager to challenge something else.  I'm eager to learn behavior, and not counter it - but manipulate it.  I don't want to think \"fight\" it - I want to think \"join\" and \"steer\".

I agree that there is a danger in tarnishing the 'fresh food experience' with brand names.  But, I think that in actuality the branding game has been underway within the world of fruits and vegetables for hundreds of years now.  As an example, carrots were traditionally grown in multiple colors.  But in the 17th century Dutch farmers started cultivating only orange carrots as a tribute to William of Orange, the leader of the struggle for Dutch independence.  Who knew a brightly colored root vegetable could be the 'branded' symbol of political freedom?  As with carrots there is most probably a story behind every fruit and vegetable name and variety that we otherwise take for granted.  All that I am proposing is that brands utilize that tradition to further their brand identity exposure.  And attract the attention of kids to the fruit and vegetable aisle.  But you are correct in that there is quite a mythology of nature to be considered if this concept were to be developed.

Yeah... after staring at all the piles of different apples at the grocery store it hit me - why are none of these apple names branded?  Fuji, Gala, Granny Smith, even Macintosh, no one really 'owns' these names.  So why wouldn't a brand develop a new variety of apple and give it their own name?  Heck, even Apple (the company) could have some fun and do their own apple.  How about the 'Steve' apple?  Apple's brand recognition would then stretch into the grocery store and be certain that everyone thought of them when they were picking out fruit.  There could even be Apple Store tie-ins with 'Steve' pie baking contests at the Genius Bar.  Ha ha, now I am off on a tangent.

Stop talking, start doing. 2. Start something. Even if your school/community garden just starts with one tomato plant, it is better than not starting anything at all (at USM, we started in stages. First, with composting from one dining room. Then the garden. Now they have the makings of a model school/community garden and food waste composting system in place).3. Food is a huge social justice issue. Only in the USA do we see obesity and childhood hunger in the same community. 4. Form community partnerships. Reach out.5. Engage youth.6. Worms, worms, worms!!!

The clever onion tie-in references something Shrek said back in the first movie.  I bet that kids, because they say the Vidalia onion promotional display, are now going back and rewatching the first movie, or buying it if they didn't already have it.  All this visibility in the produce aisle I am sure has helped to keep kid's attention focused on Shrek, has reinforced the older Shrek material in their minds and has gotten kids talking about Shrek to their friends.

Good thoughts about Disney cooking classes.  It might be very interesting for Pixar (owner of Ratatouille) to host 'Cooking with Ratatouille' classes.  The only difference between them and Disney is that Disney has a vast array of facilities around the world that could easily host such events whereas Pixar, I think, does not.  But I see no reason why Pixar couldn't do a 'tie-in' cooking class event at somewhere like Crate & Barrel or Williams Sonoma.  Ratatouille cooking classes for kids in those stores could open up huge new opportunities for Crate & Barrel or Williams Sonoma to attract the attention of a younger category of customer.  Which makes me start to think about the possibility of 'Kid Cooking' sections in those stores.  They could be stocked with kid sized utensils, lighter pots and pans for easier handling, fun cookbooks, food science experiment lab kits, food themed movies and video games.  The list goes on and on.

Some interesting ideas there.  I like thought of connecting kids to an online community and something larger and longer-lasting than just the in-store display.

Of course pre-packaged recipe ingredients would require a bit of coordination with the local grocery store staff but an issue not insurmountable to be sure.  Maybe a new recipe is featured every week that the film (or book) is in the theaters (or prominent in bookstores).  Kids could go online and watch a video of Remy offering tips on how to prepare that dish, read comments from other kids or post photos/videos of their own attempts.  And then the newly cultivated community of kids who have taken recipes and signed up online are given first notice about the DVD release or a companion cookbook, etc.  I like it!

This way, children will learn to cook at a young age, and understand not only that it can be simple, but that it is fun and tastes good.

There are many ways this could play out as well. \nWe need to consider:\n1) How will we create the tattoos? We will need to do some vendor research to see how this can be done. I can't imagine this would be terribly difficult, we already see some forms of 'tattoos' on eggs, and edible ink has been around for decades. I'd love to make it a sustainable ink...maybe even flavored? What if a batch of grapes had mini-smiley face tattoos that tasted like apples? WAY FUN! This might challenge a child's palate, but I think foster conversations with children (What is that, a grape? But it also tastes like what other fruit? Apples!).\n2) Will we begin branded or unbranded? To Brent, Mike, and Demian's points,  I know brands carry a lot of weight. But I wouldn't want businesses to charge extra for branded fruits just to give them increased profits. We'd certainly need to work on a go to market strategy for this.\n3) Will fresh foods come w/ tattoos or will tattoos and markers be sold separately...or free? I envision this could go either way, depending on partnerships with supermarkets (to Mike's point), and partnerships we get (not expecting Prada anytime soon Brent...sorry!), plus also the cost. \n4) How will this help encourage more healthy eating? As a stand alone concept, tattoos and markers will certainly encourage fun interactions and therefore positive associations with fresh food for children. But on a deeper level, tattoos would be part of a larger program, a bigger idea. I recall \"tazo tops collectibles\" in chip bags in the 90's. And I've seen some incredible ideas surrounding games in the other concepts.....would there be a 'collect them all 'component? Will it be a \"Healthy Foods program on the Jamie Oliver site\" - especially for the adults who are trying to find easy ways to incorporate fresh foods into their lives?\nThe feedback is great guys.

Plug into what kids do already: Play and Caretake. Kids play with their toys but they also mind their toys. They do this in obvious ways (typically: boy and girl tots and older girls) such as putting a toy to bed, but also in less obvious ways (typically: older boys) such as placing best friend toy cars together to keep each other company. So, create a charming doll or an animal that comes with a plate and food choices so that it is the child's role to create daily meals for the toy. The toy then will give feedback based on the nutritional content in the meal. The feedback will be concrete--\"Too much food: I'm too tired to play now\" or \"Yummy almonds. I think they make my heart healthy, do they?  Though geared for younger kids there is no need to shy away from specific nutritional info, instead the feedback can help kids become familiar with food and the body--\"Milk is full of protein. Thanks for helping my bones grow stronger.\" (off the top of my head examples, btw).\r\nThis toy is developmentally appropriate and it lays the groundwork for understanding and feeling invested in more involved and complicated food issues when the child is older.  It is biologically hard for young kids to make good choices. They do not yet have the brain development. But they CAN make good choices for others (because it is not caught up with their own needs and desires) and in doing so in a very simple format they are familiar with and can play with straight out of the box they can practice good choices and learn what choices are good and not so good, and more so, they can tie what we eat to a specific nutritional consequence. The goal is: children will be equipped with the knowledge to make smart food choices when their brains develop the higher thinking and future thinking as well as the delayed gratification we adults all rely on to make good choices.  \r\nReally, the easiest way to encourage children to choose fresh over processed foods is to make sure the fresh foods taste better than the processed foods. Unfortunately, there is a massively powerful industry trying to do exactly the opposite by fooling our senses and taking advantage of our hurried society. My concept offers another way to encourage children to choose fresh foods: on one level the toy offers knowledge about food but on another perhaps more important level it  allows for a positive, fun association with food, health and the notion of making food choices and how important the consequences of food choice are (while tapping into a desire to care and take care of) thus laying the groundwork for mindful eating and good food choices (i.e., nutritionally sound fresh foods).

Tangelos are a hybrid of tangerines and pomelos.  A portobello mushroom tastes 'meatier' than a crimini because it has been allowed to mature further.  There are many examples.

Maybe they are a slightly different color or a brighter flavor (or sweeter, or more tangy, whatever). But they are different.  Then there might be advertisements for not only Smucker's Grape Jelly but also Smucker's Grapes! Which might catch kid's attention.  Which is my main point.

As long as kids are engaging in the design process and learning about the about the benefits fresh fruits and vegetables, I think this concept would be a step in the right direction. Introducing kids to the concept that they can design objects ie., have more control over the products they own and use,  is one important outcome of this concept.\n@ Jeremy : Thanks for the feedback. Waste is an important consideration. Making composting part of the program could help with this issue. An alternative would be to scale down the design to create smaller accessories: watches, shoes or jewelry.

(not to mention that I am a sucker for axonometric cartoon worlds)  It is a great way to present a lot of information logically, memorably and in a relatively short amount of time.  However, a couple issues were raised with me after watching it.  First, I wonder if the information is simplified a little too much.  For example, people's expanding girth is attributed to increased consumption of meat, oil, etc.  But is it only that?  Nothing is mentioned of portion size, increased amounts of processed foods, globalized marketing, etc.  Too much information can become confusing and boring but the danger here is that simplifying the causal explanation can maybe distort the solution.  Secondly, the positive message of the video is to eat more locally.  But it seems as though the subtext here feels a bit nationalistic.  Traditional local foods (rice, fish, etc.) are touted as good but outside foods from other countries (meat, oil, etc.) are seen as bad.  Japanese flags are put on foods to mark 'good' while foreign flags suggest 'cheap, bulk' infiltration.  Is the video suggesting that increased nationalism is the answer?  Is this subtle isolationism?  But the anomaly here is the information that 40% of the ingredients of traditional Tempura Soba is imported.  So does this mean that traditional eating habits, as good as they may be, also hold flaws?  Should Tempura Soba be removed from Japanese menus?  I am not sure that just because something can't be grown in a country suggests that it shouldn't be eaten by that country's population.  Maybe a more subtle argument, or different logic approach may be needed.  But the video is definitely great as a way to spur conversation about finding solutions.

I was hoping that many of the ideas that other people have come up with would find a place somewhere within the framework of EAT and hopefully would be used to then bring to their own school programmes anyway.\nWhen I was considering my submission I was looking at Vegetable Circus and loads of the other amazing ideas that have been thrown up so far.  The general thrust is that some ideas are very specific, some cover several areas (Vegetable Circus included) - for maximum impact many of the ideas here need a framework that will need developing that encompasses many of these ideas to the point where it's a continuous process throughout the year.\nMy friend Alastair mailed me last night and he had this to say: \n\"A lot of the stuff around creating behaviour change through 'awareness' campaigns is verging on useless, because we're competing in a field alongside brands with big advertising budgets and big street traction - so those things always appeal more to adults than children. The most interesting core element of the 'Educate all the time' concept is actually stepping away from those things towards the choice architecture / ambient conditions stuff - in other words, getting into everyday culture in ways advertising can't, so its the \"good\" food ethic (I use that word with a heavy sense of suspended judgement!) is always the most clear and tangible in any given room.\"\nI agree to a point; but what a lot of the ideas here allude to is a 'fight fire with fire' approach.  The snack and beverage industries have millions to spend in branding and awareness campaigns, all of which are designed to influence our behaviour to make sure we buy their products.  We must do the same to promote healthier eating, but do so in such a way so it becomes entrenched in our very psyche.  Thankfully, designing choice as illustrated by the authors of Nudge, can have a tangible effect as seen in Redesign the Cafe, and some of the other ideas presented in EAT.  In addition, schools, particularly primary schools, represent one of the last bastions of institutions that are relatively free from advertisement, and therefore the place to engage with young minds.\n", "user": "b419aa71200ed65b3c31b6f959c2e707", "date": "September 12, 2010, 05:25PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 16}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "eat._educate_all_the_time.", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Love this!

Here's how I see our concepts overlapping, as they do for 17 of the 21 points you bring:\n1) Understanding Time: Vegetable Circus stage shows can occur in the school, during the school day; our after-school programs bring the education to the kids.  That education will include the training to make the kids capable of following through themselves the rest of the year.\n2) Educate Parents: Supplementary take-home materials will focus on including the parents in the process, so they can make sure their kids cook at home, help with shopping, and play safely.\n3) Start Early: This program is aimed at elementary-aged children (5-10), the earliest ages that we can effectively target.\n4) Re-Educate Dinner Staff: Not currently covered, but possible.\n5) Good Food is Convenient: A message promoted and explained by all of our programs.\n6) Theme It: The Vegetable Circus is a theme itself; the after-school programs could use cultural themes for both food and play education.\n7) Cross-Curriculum: We cross movement arts training with food education, plus some social & mental skills along the way.\n8) Re-design the Cafe: Not currently covered, but possible.\n9) Join a Club: We'd be creating clubs in the form of after-school programs. There is a focus on trying new things in our programs, which should also set up kids to try and join new clubs later in life.\n10) Update Parents (I): Take-home materials for parents to supplement the initial stage show experience, and then internet-based updates for parents kids in after-school programs could be a good idea as well. \n11) Make Food Fun: Vegetable Circus shows exist to demonstrate this exact point!\n12) Apply the Law of the Few: Consider that our initial stage show is designed to have performers which children consider cool and popular use their knowledge and skills to subtly convince children to take charge of their own health.  \n13) Tell Kids How Much They Love Broccoli: Our programs focus on using methods that work more genuinely than \"triggering false memories\", but we certainly tell kids how much we love healthy foods and talk to them about retrying foods.\n14) Involve Parents in Pricing: Not sure how we'd include this.\n15) Work with Role Models: Exactly why we're using talented performers to deliver these messages, on stage and after-school.\n16) Join Communities: See \"9) Join a Club\"\n17) Update Parents (II): Final performances have been a part of the after-school programming, where they can demonstrate what they've learned or created to their family and community. \n18) Come Dine with Us (I): Yes, we should have kids cooking; this ought to become part of the after-school programs. And this is one of those places where Jamie's help in particular would be golden.\n19) Come Dine with Us (II): I'm not sure how this would be implemented.\n20) Positive Association: This does work; we love seeing how kids react to free fruit! And our whole program uses this technique by demonstrating the benefits of healthy lifestyles in a fun and exciting manner.\n21) Advertise in Public Places: The Vegetable Circus is a living, breathing advertisement; once the programs have some degree of popularity, we could unite the right allies to promote healthy eating as proposed.", "user": "b1bbf4f42563deb613ba7ce2171c302f", "date": "September 12, 2010, 02:40AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 16}}], "themes": [], "comment_count": 8, "title": "EAT.

As you say, the financials will always be the biggest challenge. I'm doing my own at-home challenge in November to see if I can do it in my daughter's lunches for a week. I actually think it's very do-able if you focus on a plant-based diet with beans as a primary protein source. Healthy too! \nI also think integrating farm-toschool with this concept has a lot of potential as well. I worked to start an 11-acre farm, and I can speak from experience when I say that food waste is a sad but regular occurrence on even the most sustainably-minded farm. If we could harness the bargaining power of impending waste and school-district size volume (i.e. come to the farmers' market at the end of the day, and make some deals and be prepared to take it ALL) then the price for fresh food could be significantly reduced. \nOf course, that requires whoever's making the lunches to be VERY nimble when it comes to fresh ingredients - and that's where culinary education and kids in the kitchen pays off - they are the most creative cooks I know! :) \nI'd say the biggest barrier is: working kitchens. In the two districts where I've worked, the kitchens were dismantled in favor of heat & serve literally decades ago. I helped get an old, mothballed kitchen back online (with kids' help!) at Full Circle Farms' home middle school - it was a beautiful transformation. \nBut - word to the weary: it took almost 3 years to get that kitchen going, and nearly as long to start getting ANY of the farm's produce into the school!

I think Teresa's comment below is interesting.  Since food companies would probably lobby against it's use at typical markets, maybe this type of cart would simply target the stores that the food companies compete to get into such as Wal-Mart, Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  Those stores can probably dictate terms more than others.  Not to mention that it could reinforce each store's health conscious brand identity.  What if the cart could also scan the items that were going into it and then send information to the shoppers smart phone or iPad?  Put in a chicken, some parsley and fava beans and the cart would then send a list of possible recipes that could be made with these ingredients.  The shopper would then save the ones that were interesting and continue on, adding the other needed ingredients and building meals for the week.  Sort of like a shopping list on the fly.  The cart could also give nutritional information.  Drop in some carrots and it could tell you about the vitamins it has, growing season, where the carrots were sourced from, best preparations, etc.  Also, as it scans, the cart could keep a running tally of price, price per lb./g, total calorie content, etc. and give suggestions on how to nutritionally balance what is being bought.

My thinking is that kids are going to watch TV anyway.  And they usually watch pretty ridiculously vacuous stuff.  So to produce a TV show that is actually trying to present knowledge about healthy food and encourage healthy eating choices I think is a good thing.  And, as you mention, to do so in a fun competitive format could really attract kid's attention.Also, I think this show would be the catalyst for a large amount of educational opportunities.  The schools that participate in the competition could generate a huge amount of curriculae as they prepare in the months before the show.  History lessons to research the origins of the selected vegetables, farm visits to learn about agriculture and proper cultivation, recipe development and writing lessons, in-school cooking class pre-competitions to select the final team to compete, etc.  There is a lot of potential there for building knowledge about vegetables.  And, considering that the last time Jamie took a camera into an American classroom and the kids didn't know what a tomato was... we have a lot of work to do.I think a competition based reality show would be a great way to hget kids excited about cooking and eating healthy food.  And educate them in the process.  So a little time in front of the TV to help build knowledge of, and interest in healthy food I think is a good trade-off.Thanks again Aaron!

Maybe a major portion of the cooking competition happens, as you say, on an inter-school level, just as varsity sports does.  Schools compete with other participating schools in their area with winners going on to state level championships.  Winners of large region or state competitions would then compete against other winners on Jamie's show.

Great idea to have people share their attempts at the show's featured recipes or other dishes featuring the episode's highlighted ingredient.

Maybe there could be a 'Vegipedia' section where people can contribute information about the featured vegetables, posting growing tips, history facts, science experiments, etc.  And to make it fun for kids maybe there could be a section where kids could upload photos and descriptions of their failed attempts at cooking the featured recipe or the yuckiest tasting thing they ate with the featured ingredients.  Jamie has never been afraid to gross out kids from time to time:)  Then encourage kids to suggest fixes or different techniques to each other to improve their cooking attempts or make a dish taste as good as it possibly can.  Another thing to figure out would be a way to translate some of the show and website content to a texting situation.

Great idea to incorporate Farmer's Market farmers into the program. Not only could they stop by some of the urban plots that the kids are tending and give lessons and helpful pointers on cultivation, but day-long field trips could be scheduled to take the kids in the program out to the country to visit the farmers on their farms.  They could tour the operations and hear the farmers describe how they care for all of their produce.  As you mentioned, connecting the kids to actual farmers is very important.  When they see the care and effort that goes into cultivating their vegetables, I would bet that kids would better be able to see produce as valuable and treat it with more attention and respect.  This would also be a great way for kids to draw a conceptual line from the food on their plate back to its source. I think you are right in getting the kids to see and interact with young, hip farmers.  Showing them someone that they could identify with and relate to would probably help to make the job of growing food for people more real to them and, therefore, more interesting.

I think putting kids in direct contact with food, farms, and farmers is critical to expanding how they thing about what they eat.  Check out the American Center for Sustainability.  In the Spring 2010 issue of Edible Portland, the cover story was about the Center's mobile seedling program.  They converted an old public transit bus into a mobile greenhouse to deliver seedlings to urban pea-patch farmers.  The bus itself is very cool - even the front bumper was turned into a garden space.  \nI suggest adding options for Farmers Market participants to be volunteers in the program.  In addition to the food, connecting kids to the farmers is key.  Using farmers as educators in this model would be a powerful addition.  In the Pac NW, many of the farmers are young hip families themselves - something kids and families can easily relate to.\nThanks for the great idea here.

Eddie, I like the idea of using trucks to bring the farm to the kids.  I think there was an early inspiration about that... I'll have to go back and look... but that could definitely be an aspect of this concept.  Actually, maybe the trucks could not only be the 'barn' but also a 'greenhouse'.  Maybe the flat roof of the truck could be fitted with modular plexi-glass 'greenhouse' boxes.  The clear boxes could hold seedlings to be planted at various lots, herbs to bring to classes for cooking demonstrations, lettuces, etc.  The boxes could then be taken off of the roof and lowered to street level to give kids access to them.  In tight urban environments utilizing every sun-touched surface, even the truck roof, to grow vegetables and herbs, is vital!Also, as you mentioned, taking advantage of warehouses could work too.  Maybe big roof gardens could be constructed that groups of kids could be taken to.  These permanent 'farming centers' could also have things that vacant lot gardens couldn't, like chickens for eggs.

Vincent! Thank you for your link. When conducting my research (user testing) I realized it was really difficult to create a functional lunch box divided solely on the basis of each food group (For example: what about combination foods like a sandwich?) That is why this system has three segments (dividing a meal into 3 components) with an accompanying packaging system all using an \"Exchange system\".

And thanks for the research!  Agreed there are definitely some similar ideas to Vincent's concept from a few days ago.  Maybe a hybrid collaboration could happen? :)  I like the idea of a flash card box with recipes and tips for each meal component.  Maybe there could be a way to translate that to an online iteration?  Meaning; when the parent buys the weekly kit either the purchase is noted by the Pronto system or the parent emails/texts Pronto to initiate the start of the week.  Then each evening Pronto emails both the parent and the kid with recipes and instructions for assembly of the next day's lunch components.

Yes you are right, one of the great qualities of modularity is an ability to adapt to a given context as scale & shape permit.  However given this particular challenge, its sheer scale, massive audience (America's youth) and most importantly its URGENCY; \"every instance [being] the same\" has tremendous advantages.  Imagine James Naismith's layout and rules of a basketball court.  For the most part, they are universal all over the world and have achieved an far reaching iconic quality known.  This leads to them being universally learned, recognized and practiced by people all over the world despite their many differences.  Gardening & farming in schools, parks and any other available public spaces need to be distributed with a similar universal+iconic layout and set of rules+standards if they are to reach children in the same way.Moreover, there are far too many community gardens that simply make do with what urban infill spaces are available and many times these places are unsuitable for children.  Meanwhile, there is no shortage of dry turf or asphalt within the American public parks and schools where such a layout could be as easily & rapidly implemented in the manner in which basketball courts have been. I remember walking the \"Not a Cornfield\" Project in Lincoln Heights.  It's an amazing project and a continual transformation of the city.  I thought it was very experimental, radical and necessary.  I still do and I think it something that all Los Angelenos can be proud of.  However, in order to meet the scope of Jamie Oliver's challenge, it's now necessary for efforts to evolve from separate, experimental and radical to unified, synthesized and mainstream.

I think one point that should be made is that just because it is modular, does not mean that every instance is the same.

For example, you could have a first wave of modules that seek to reclaim lost urban space (whether due to site damage or the expansion of park systems). The next phase of modules could then use the now improved site to yield crops. The entire process of growing and land reclamation would be a very useful tool for education.

Kids love nurturing virtual pets and places, Nintendo DS etc have already demonstrated this. The idea that the children could feed their virtual child and perhaps make better food choices than they would for their real self is quite an interesting idea. It may help tie up their engagement with their diet and the implications it has on their bodies.\nIt needs to be carefully constructed (in consultation with psychologists who specialise in children's eating habits) or I think this concept presents certain risks. I don't think we should be encouraging children to label food options as \"good\" or \"bad\" but rather encouraging them to create a moderate balance to which our bodies are best suited. My friends who have the most healthy relationship with food can sit down and enjoy a slice of cake without thinking of it as sinful. It is those for whom the slice of cake is steeped in guilt that are more likely to be trapped in unhealthy relationships with food. \nI don't think the idea of tackling the issue of third world poverty and poor nutritional choices is the right way to sensitively encourage and enable children to make healthy food choices. The idea of starting the \"game\" with a starving child could be harmful and offensive. It is teaching extremes, when we should be teaching moderation. \nEating will always be an emotional experience, our bodies are designed to receive information about what we are putting into our mouths in this way. We need to build knowledge and understanding in young children so that their food choices can be informed with facts and not just feelings. This concept could be a great tool if constructed carefully to better synthesise the drivers behind a child's food choices.\n", "user": "52f4ef2d88db729b255fbfd2cad9b709", "date": "September 19, 2010, 12:38PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 16}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "sponsor_a_virtual_child", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Interesting concept.
