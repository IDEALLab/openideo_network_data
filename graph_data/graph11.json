I'm a daily Yelp user myself and if such a website/phone app existed for socially conscious businesses, I would definitely factor that into consideration when choosing which businesses to give my money to. This puts \"consumer choice\" front and center, and gives the power back to customers (average citizens) to hold companies accountable to their social footprint.

I know a lot of people live on the internet nowadays, but a physical indication of community support (or lack thereof) like a sticker can go really, really far. Ultimately people still interact daily with their physical environment, many businesses still have an office, and a lot of people don't actually live on the intrawebs or remember to check on a website/phone app before choosing a business.

Many more corporations with great power comes to mind, but to avoid what Andre pointed out in terms of authenticity/countering skepticism from the public, I think corporations must be mindful of how they integrate these well-intentioned moves into their business model and strategy. In the case of Pepsi, Performance with Purpose is a comprehensive strategy that touches almost all the key stakeholders of Pepsi's business model: consumers, distributors, and suppliers. Pepsi's financial performance hinges quite heavily upon whether Performance with Purpose succeeds because Performance with Purpose is central to their long-term strategy. On the other hand, there are many corporations that have well-intentioned initiatives that are not central to its business model or strategy. An example that comes to mind is Goldman Sachs' \"10,000 small businesses\" that provides business education, access to capital, and business support services to small businesses. While this is a very noble initiative, it is much easier to \"poke holes\" in the initiative's intention because this initiative is almost entirely unrelated to Goldman's business model and long term strategy -- working with small business is not how Goldman makes money. Compare and contrast this to American Express' OPEN -- a division devoted exclusively to small businesses, that have started numerous initiatives to support small businesses. One such initiative is Small Business Saturday, which makes the Saturday after Thanksgiving THE day for consumers to shop at small businesses by providing Amex cardholders $25 credit for shopping at participating small businesses. Much like Pepsi Performance with Purpose, this initiative touches key stakeholders -- merchants and consumers -- that are central to Amex's business model. In short, I believe it is much harder to be skeptical of benevolent business initiatives when they are truly integral to the success of corporations. \r\rOne more point -- how important is public perception of these initiatives to the actual impact and \"good\" that is created for the world? Personally I feel that a positive public perception is a great bonus, but not necessary to create positive world benefit! So while I think it is easier to poke holes at Goldman's 10,000 small business initiative, it is still a noble effort to be applauded and admired! :) ", "user": "afc903c3f817f35805b5740464161e41", "date": "October 01, 2012, 01:31AM", "sub_comments": [{"py/id": 11}]}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "pepsi_performance_with_purpose", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Really nice provocation Veronica  it reminds me of that quote from Star Wars: with great power comes great responsibility :) I'll be eager to see what other examples our community can surface in Inspiration, and how we might design concepts to enable these powerful companies to 'use their power for good'!", "user": "884b3f632f6af8e3f87b26795b8a4f31", "date": "September 27, 2012, 09:30PM", "sub_comments": [{"py/id": 11}]}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "pepsi_performance_with_purpose", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I love this example and just hope that the intent is true and that the public will see this as an authentic initiative.

As we get into Concepting, though, our goal will be to find ways to support for-profit businesses that want to innovate for world benefit  not simply by setting up a charitable foundation or donating profits, for instance, but rather by developing new products/services or by rethinking the way they deliver value to their customers. Ultimately our goal will be to find ways for companies to create social impact while driving their own business goals forward. \r\rJust something to consider for when we move into Concepting.

And I agree it is not money: money comes inevitably with a true innovation, by definition. In my view, there are two lines of benefits that a company can get out of a recognition: worldwide awareness (consciousness) of their contribution (which can be understood as a powerful marketing multiplier tool) AND an effective worldwide brand recognition that sets an easy market ground for the company's next product, sort of a red carpet for the next product (i.e who is not eager or curious to know what is the next apple device will be). Innovation is associated with creativity, but nothing comes out of any company by chance. Where there is one great innovation hit, chances are high there will be another. It happens a little bit like in the Art Scene: when a masterpiece is identified in an artists, chances are high that the artist will do more than one masterpiece. And there we are, may be the recognition platform is a center that signals worldwide, just as MOMA does with art, for instance. May be it is a tower that outstands in a major city, such as New York, and flags out the company's brand in recognition for their contribution (similar to 'The person of the year' of a business magazine, but using a visible and cool language different from that of a magazine)", "user": "30e4cf98e79ad6962ff3c26a70309578", "date": "October 23, 2012, 04:16PM", "sub_comments": [{"py/id": 11}]}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "incentives_for_innovation", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Nice thinking here Lluis  I agree that the financial benefits will come if the innovation is truly innovative!

The Walk of Fame is a great American phenomenon, but strongly tied to the American culture. I believe we need forms that can emotionally grasp the heart of anyone. What I liked about the concept is that it refers to 'attitudes', because innovation inevitably requires 'attitudes'.

I am regular of the Island of Ibiza (Spain). This island has had the unique ability to develop a culture of music composed by DJs that has spread all over the world. Ibiza is the place to be if you want to be a the top of the DJ profession, worldwide. At the moment, the town hall is redefining the Port of Ibiza, and one of the ideas that was proposed to citizens was to create a 'Walk of DJs' in the port. The port is part of the World Heritage by UNESCO. There were many citizens that blatantly rejected the idea, stating that this is an american way to pay tribute to the DJs, and the way to be used should be more in line with the local culture (Ibiza has it's own unique language, even in architecture).

I think what motivates companies to want a certain prize, is more than the award money, indeed. Some have it in their values, and want a prize to show they're really doing what they say they will do. And some prizes bring a lot of recognition in terms of media coverage, which can equal a lot of Euros in advertising money.

This, for example, could be gained by getting a company that wins the prize a spot in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for its industry. Being part of that, will increase the attractiveness of the share to investors. Obviously, this would only work for publicly traded companies.\r\rAs for the tax benefits: I think that's a very good economic incentive. But, I also like to think of it the other way around.

If this externalising of costs could be reversed by taxing companies for perceived risk to environment, health and society as a whole, then that would be an automatic advantage for companies that do not externalise those costs.

It will feature later, in 'Creating Shared Value'. The impact of the paper itself is to influence one government's policy and bring in two others to create the social enterprise initiative described:\r\r\"Enterprise is any organizational activity aimed at a specific output or outcome. Once the output or outcome  the primary objective  is clear, an organization operating to fulfill the objective is by definition an enterprise. Business is the most prominent example of enterprise. A business plan, or organizational map, provides a reference regarding how an organizational scheme will operate to produce a specific outcome: provision of products or services in a way to create profit. Profit in turn is measured numerically in terms of monetary gains, the bottom line.\r\rThis is the function of classic capitalism, which has proven to be the most powerful economic engine ever devised.\r\rAn inherent assumption about capitalism is that profit is defined only in terms of monetary gain. This assumption is virtually unquestioned in most of the world. However, it is not a valid assumption. Business enterprise, capitalism, must be measured in terms of monetary profit. That rule is not arguable. A business enterprise must make monetary profit, or it will merely cease to exist. That is an absolute requirement. But it does not follow that this must necessarily be the final bottom line and the sole aim of the enterprise. How this profit is used is another question. It is commonly assumed that profit will enrich enterprise owners and investors, which in turn gives them incentive to participate financially in the enterprise to start with.\r\rThat, however, is not the only possible outcome for use of profits. Profits can be directly applied to help resolve a broad range of social problems: poverty relief, improving childcare, seeding scientific research for nationwide economic advancement, improving communications infrastructure and accessibility, for examples  the target objectives of this particular project plan. The same financial discipline required of any conventional for-profit business can be applied to projects with the primary aim of improving socioeconomic conditions. Profitability provides money needed to be self-sustaining for the purpose of achieving social and economic objectives such as benefit of a nations poorest, neediest people.

You are absolutely correct. It is a corporate-sponsored incubator for social entrepreneurs. I call it the Institute because of its mission and broader societal aspirations. \r\r+ How are entrepreneurs and their innovations selected? My first thought is through competitions (posted and evaluated in an online platform) that address specific challenges; some can be more open-ended. Although the competitions are open to all, college students or recent college graduates are the target demographic. Because of the conditions in the labor markets, this demographic would likely be drawn to the Institute, which is designed to reduce entry barriers for social entrepreneurs by providing the necessary resources. However, diversity along several dimensions is at the core of this model.\r\r+ How can we make this an attractive sponsorship vehicle for companies? Excellent question. \r\rCompanies are incentivized in a variety of ways:\r(1) Branding. The brand value works in multiple ways. In the same way that companies such as Nike sponsor athletes to train for the Olympics, for-profit companies, through the Institute, sponsor social entrepreneurs to realize their efforts, which are tied directly to world benefit. To be clear, the for-profit corporate sponsors also provide resources to the Institute itself. In terms of branding, equally important is the affiliation with the Institute itself; affiliated sponsors send a strong signal to not only investors, but also to communities. If the impact extends to developing nations, then brands can experience a preference in emerging markets.\r(2) Financial Incentive. Participating for-profit companies have the first option of investing in these social ventures. Risk is accounted for in the model by having a critical mass of corporate sponsors (to sustain the Institute and attract talent).\r(3) R&D.

If it was simply a matter of investing in social enterprise silently for returns, governments would surely have had much more success by now.\r\rThe relationship between brands and our identities as first consumers and secondly citizens seems to be growing ever tighter... Nike and Apple have turned the product into a service, and then into a community. Nike Plus is the best example I can think of... runners really feel they belong to something.\r\rAs we allow the identity of brands to seep ever further into our own projections of self, we also begin to influence the identity of the brand and create a symbiotic relationship. I can only see expansion in the opportunities for for-profit business investing in social progress.\r\rIn a slightly Orwellian conclusion, if Apple or Google's profits keep on raising in line with the debt ceiling, are they eventually going to be tied to a more paternal, stewarding role to the citizens that they require sustain them, in the same way that government spends the taxes it collects?

I can think of 3 options off the top of my head... (1) peer judges - competing teams rate one another's entries.  (2) domain expert judges rate entries in their domains, according to a list of criteria that we'd have to define. (3) general public votes - this becomes more of a popularity contest, where those with the most social media influence win.\r\r- So many possible ways to do winner recognition. Most of the suggestions on OpenIdeo pertain to recognizing the businesses. I think in addition to that, recognizing high scoring teams in front of their fellow colleagues would be motivating for the team members, and may also encourage future participation from other employees.\r\r- Interesting nuance about what types of challenges each business can do. I had initially envisioned teams being judged according to the domain of their chosen project, not the industry of their employer - I imagined teams would choose topics outside their scope of business. However, thinking out loud as well....  if teams choose topics that are in line with the company's business, then we might get more impactful projects that companies are motivated to pursue longer term. But that brings up the issue of security and IP. Maybe it's possible not to divulge sensitive information during the tournament.

Roger, a crowdsourced forum (much like this one!) could be created where the public votes on their favorite Comics of Good.

Using Malcolm Gladwell's tipping point principles, one of the popular stories can be circulated to influential members of the community (\"connectors\", \"mavens\", and \"persuaders\") who will retell it through online their social networks. At the same time, the narrative must be memorable when told in word-of-mouth in order to reach populations without regular access to the internet.\r\rIn terms of measurement and tracking, Comics of Good can be hosted on a shared website where standard metrics can be collected regarding page views. Anytime a link is shared, it takes viewers back to the site.

No one can control market better than business organizations that understand weak points and strengths of different business activities.  I believe the current worldwide economic situations is because of too much government influences in everything worldwide. As you might have noticed outcome of private companies and government section organizations are too different. Society is better off with more private section activities.\rGovernments do nothing free. For each step they take, they tax people tremendously, and they very rarely spend tax incomes in their promised ways! For instance they may tax residents and promise them to repair roads for them and change asphalts, but they spend money elsewhere instead. Like paying welfare to healthy lazy people who do not wish to work.  \rThe idea of auction which limits government access to money that business organization would spend for poor people is good. I assume you figured it out that government needs to be limited to avoid corruptions.  \rSponsoring poor families is a wonderful idea. But it depends what it means. If supporting poor families means paying their expenses from tax money and leaving them to live happily ever after, it is exploiting middle class tax payers. But as an ancient Chinese proverb says, Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.

If that is the case, I don't think so. People understand stories and 'purpose' differently, and to frame what is valuable 'purpose' and what is not is tough. It will also be tougher to incentivize companies to innovate for world benefit if we set guidelines. However, that is not to say that businesses and companies need not to legitimize the human story that they are weaving through promoting their social outreach, because they are most likely going to benefit from such a story. Moreover, having a purpose within a company doesn't equate to receiving all the benefits I have listed in my post (I am sure there are more, but I have no expertise in this field).

I would like to think that there could be space for a pre-selective process for artists that could be interested in shaping the masterpiece (for a given selected company and potentially a product or type of solution) which could be understood or defined as a sort of open contest where artists would describe conceptually what their masterpiece would consist of (if selected). Obviously the art piece essentials should somehow address the issues / areas that have made that company / proposal be selected ... which is the point of the whole set up. I would think that it is a process similar to that of architects proposing a solution to a contest for a project (they hand in a proposal and one of them is selected by a jury according to a given criteria). Some requirements need to be met, but on the other hand, there needs to be a high degree of freedom, as it is the basis of any art creation.

I would agree with you that the activity of the art center would be somehow strating to stock new masterpieces ... which would in turn start spinning the wheel of another line of business (the explotation of such pieces within the art scene market) ... but perhaps this other line of business is for other art businesses (such as MOMA) to take on within their exhibition spaces.

And to me, this is an initiative from the Arts Scene that is somehow recognising Apple's contribution to society, is the tip of an Iceberg. A museum of modern art is embracing a product! Art and Business are shaking hands! To me this is a startig point, and it is about builiding on this ... not so much on turning products or pictures of products into art pieces, but on letting the art scene work for society by focusing and developing pieces that address how companies are providing great contributions to society. Universal positive reach, for citizens and for companies. Bringing the art scene closer to the business scene and the other way around.

Fred Polak, the sociologist and futurist, wrote a book on \"the guiding image\" of the future and asked: what are characteristics of societies that are able to give birth to new dynamic positive images, across the culture, especially in troubled times. His answer: it can happen in societies that value the artists. Why? Because guiding images of a society have power not based on the cognitive/analytic content, but because of the emotion-creating dimensions.  \r\rImagine a MOCCA for new images of business as an agent of world benefit!  \r\rAn imaginarium....an immersion experience into the new and the better---and everything designed to evoke not a utopian sense but a sense of the possible via threads and patterns woven from the texture of the actual. \r\rthanks Lluis....what fun. \r\r\r\r", "user": "273c081a3faaffcfea2e7dcbf604252d", "date": "October 23, 2012, 08:03PM", "sub_comments": [{"py/id": 11}]}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_worldwide_business_innovation_arts_center", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi David, thanks for your comment and insights on Fred Polak. It makes me think of a comment that I heard on the Catalan news on TV a few months ago that completely grasped my attention. It was about a comment made by an ex-teacher of mine (Xavier Mena), when I studied my MBA at ESADE Business School, and who is now working in the Board of the Catalan Government. He said that since he had been working at ESADE Business School for a very long time he had been very sensitive to what programs for children and even films transmit about businesses and that to his disgrace the messages were all negative, and that this had a very disgraceful return to our societies. 'Businesses are not bad to society' he would claim. He was a defender that business provide positive impact on society. And I think he is absolutely right. And there is no worldwide platform that is out there recognising them, raising consciousness among society and encouraging people to follow initiatives. And this IDEO challenge to me has to do with this. It's about establishing this bond; it's about providing positive return; it's about making the positive wheel spin faster, about inspiring more wheels to spin. And there is nothing better than art to break molds, to reach out people and companies, to start the positive revolution. I am confident there are artists are there willing to create masterpieces that are really a nice and deep piece of thought of positive impacts and the role that a business or a product does in our society.", "user": "30e4cf98e79ad6962ff3c26a70309578", "date": "October 24, 2012, 09:11AM", "sub_comments": [{"py/id": 11}]}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_worldwide_business_innovation_arts_center", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I need to work a bit more on this ... pictures and so on.

There is a certification for just about anything. About half are worthless, and a huge portion of the remaining have apparently morphed into money pits. \r\rFor example, ASIS has numerous certifications. To get the certifications they cost almost $500 and require a person to study for a test based on information contained in books that only they sell. These materials alone run in the hundreds of dollars. When the time comes to take the test, the failure rates are high, and many attribute this to pedantic questions. This requires another couple of hundred dollars to retake the exam. After someone does pass, there is an annual due in the $400 dollar range. Also, the certification expires and requires renewal and a certain number of \"educational credits\" which can only be earned by attending ASIS events, which also run in the hundreds of dollars excluding travel costs. At the end of the day, people will spend thousands of dollars to remain \"certified.\" \r\rNow, many employers believe that these certifications carry extensive weight, which can result in people with far less actual experience, but the certification, being considered over those more qualified and experienced.

I am thinking about several things. The first is the shared hope to really advance--at a global level of learning and shift--a new image of business and society for the 21st century. This requires--as you point to--perhaps thousands and even millions of emerging \"golden innovations\"--innovations in business as an agent of world benefit, that when placed next to one another, actually help us see a new pattern.  Along these lines, it is clear that there are many prizes emerging focusing on sustainability: the dairy industry prize for sustainability; the Northeast India Prize for Sustainability, Good Magazine's top 100; etc etc. And each one of these emerging prizes--local prizes, regional, industry, etc--is looking for ways to better broadcast the news and stories of their award nominees and recipients. So what if we created a Newswire--like PR Newswire services--and couple this with your wikipedia idea--to help award programs to \"Empower your communications\" \"distribute your content over a large distribution network\"  \"target traditional and social media distribution\" and \"engage your audiences\"?  The design goal would be to serve Award givers--to make their experience of sharing their stories easy, state of the art with images and easy video linkages, delightful, impactful, and viral. Think of all the press releases and stories pouring into the AP Newswire--being propelled outward to the high leverage sources and social media networks. So how about a newswire designed to help Award givers--magnify, amp up, speed the spread. I can also imagine an International Association of Sustainability Awards (IASA). And also an APP design to serve, support, and accentuate the work of Award givers! \r\rIf anything imaginable were possible, and there were no constraints whatesoever, how might we design a newswire and wiki that truly serves, inspires, and advances the Awards givers all over the world?

I think it is useful to look at other awards programs. J.D. Power and Associates http://businesscenter.jdpower.com/Awards.aspx is an excellent example of a respected program with several categories; I think we would want to encourage a diversity of awards to account for the complexity of recognizing diverse companies (geography, industry, size etc.).

Starting with open honest conversations with people is probably the best option.  Please note that the circumstances in our businesses are rarely just the result of one person's thinking.

Connecting the use of the soccer ball to fundraising is a unique application of this Internet-enabled technology. \r\rWhat if, instead, \"One Laptop Per Child\" (http://one.laptop.org/) collected anonymous data on students to provide feedback to teachers, parents, and policy makers? In other words, establish a more direct connection between the \"vehicle\" and the desired outcome. A well-used soccer ball (baseball, football, or basketball) means that students are not studying. Is this a desired outcome? \r\rAdditionally, laptops can collect far more data than a soccer ball.

I think the profit model is an inseparable part of the company's core business practices. This model challenges the classical notion that profits create value for shareholders / investors (capitalism's design).\r\rIn other words, at Newman's Own, profits do not go pass through a shareholder layer, where it is then determined how much should benefit society. This layer is removed; hence it is embedded in the model. Herein lies the innovation.\r\rIf we remove this aspect of the business, would Newman's Own be the same? Is the profit model simply an add-on that can be removed? I answered \"no\" to both questions. In the 30 years that the company has been in business, this has not altered.\r\rHowever, I can also see why some folks may disagree with the position, or view, that I have proposed.
