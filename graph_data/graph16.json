Sentimentality is the best way of describing what I was going for (though admittedly limited edition items can be tchotchkes or they can become sentimental things).

I think the ideal behind this concept is to give value to a tech product in the same way one might value a watch that has been passed down among generations. An item gains sentimental value when it gains a story. Perhaps \"limited edition\" is not the ideal way of giving a smartphone or a laptop a story, but this is an idea that can be built upon. Then again, you could imagine a limited edition smartphone for musicians (like example 3 above) and the musician keeping the phone for some time because they, say, had recorded their first album on it.

In my inspiration post, I asked whether consumers have an idea of the product lifespan of a laptop or a phone or another tech item. When we buy a car, for example, we expect it to run for say 15 years or 200,000 miles. I am not so sure about the lifespan of a tech product like a smartphone because we're replacing them (typically) before they are broken. This concept could help to push the idea that a smartphone is something you keep for years, decades maybe, much like we endeavor to keep our cars, trucks, and motorbikes running.\r\rHowever, we are trashing many tech products because they have become obsolete not because they are broken, the points raised in the inspirations for this concept. Even with upgradable devices consumers could face the issue of \"planned obsolescence\", especially if there is a financial incentive to get tech product owners into the store as often as possible for a potentially costly upgrade. One problem seems to be the way that new software is released in this current model of app stores and constant refining of apps. I upgrade my apps on my smartphone and tablet almost every week and it seems like each month my first-generation tablet gets slower and slower with each new upgrade (particularly upgrades to the OS). If apps keep pushing the computing limits of hardware every other week (an exaggeration I know, but not far off), we will all still need to either trash our products or upgrade every 6-12 months. An interesting question is how frequently would consumers be willing to take their phone or computer into a store for regular \"tune-ups\".

My own experience with the program was in using the small plastic envelopes with pre-paid postage, which were included along with each new cartridge, in order to send back used cartridges. HP developed a pretty robust infrastructure to also allow for drop offs and scheduled pick-ups for more heavy-duty cartridge users. \r\rI think that there's a ton of promise in instituting a similar program among mobile phone manufacturers to allow users to return their old phones or accessories. \r\rSomething that I think is really important to consider in popularizing a program like this though is how it will be messaged to users - Whereas I think you would be hard pressed to find someone who considers old printer cartridges as anything else but trash, consumers might be less willing to discard an old phone in the same way. Mobile phones are after all increasingly becoming a constant companion, alongside users literally from the moment they wake up to the moment they set their alarm and go to bed. As such, in order to increase the adoption rate of a program like this, I think it'll be essential to build a strong marketing story that helps consumers understand the value of sending in their device and the path that it might take from there - i.e. being refurbished for another user, or going to a processing plant for recycling.\r\rA.M.

Also, even if consumers do know and do care about what happens to their phone after its life, then they still need to be able to do something about it. Connecting the story to actionable steps taken by the consumer is key.

Norway also tend to have rigid policies regarding recycle and quality of products, what is very comfortable for all the consumers,  what makes us Norwegians, who want quality,  consume in  our Country, instead to buy cheaper and bad quality products abroad and be insure about the products lives.

One of their conclusions was that companies should be finding a way to create meaningful brands to consumers. One of the waves we see today is being 'socially responsible' or being 'environmentally friendly' ... but how many companies are really doing meaningful actions in this respect? I think this concept is a truly branding opportunity for a company that truly wants to build a meaningful brand for consumers. Implementing such concept can break molds in the current digital/electronic sector, and the first successful implementation can clearly appear to be a flagship service for a truly environmentally friendly company, and can act as the grounds of a new revolution in the digital / electronic design criteria. And bringing actors together to create the new generation of devices is also a challenge that can be understood as a market barrier for new entrants: aligning providers with a new design criteria is not easy, but such difficulty also results in a difficulty for competitors to copy the proposal.

Fundamentally, in my view the key tools here would be to identify and understand what this means for people -- which includes what anxieties, aspirations and ambivalence are aroused.\r\rAs a psychosocial researcher, I find it best to approach this sort of thing from the \"inside out\" rather than \"outside in.\" This means engaging in a process to better understand what this 'means' - through dialogue, low-key conversations, associations, etc, so you can recognize what is latent and there. It's a different approach to presuming there may be a 'tough sell' - which sets up a sense of uphill battle. Rather, we can presume there are latent desires, energies that we can tap into. But to do this, we must have a fine-grained sense of where people are in relation to this topic.\r\rI recently engaged in a messaging/branding project concerning green electronics. The essence was about acknowledging both the not-so-great aspects of electronics and the more exciting potentials (i.e. service). This is more truthful for where we are, perhaps - a mixture of anxiety (what does this mean for business? etc), aspiration (I want to do right!) and ambivalence (hmm, things seem to be working OK as it is). \r\rSo my suggestion here is to design social platforms as tools for initiating these conversations. Figure out how to ascertain where people are at around this topic and what it means/represents.

Thanks for sharing your view. \r\rI totally share your view on the cultural shift and addressing the psychological issues / concerns / process that this change brings inevitably along, which requires a deep understanding on where employees and consumers psychologically stand with regards to this topic, and start working from there. \r\rYour inside-out proposal makes complete sense to me, and your projects findings are certainly interesting. Four years ago I did some research on consumers too, and we came to the conclusion that at that time the consumers did not care much for a potential 'green feature' such as 'low energy consumption PC' although they complained about how often they need to change their PCs, and the problem that an obsolete PC would cause them. And I am sure that if we repeated the research now, consumers would not stand in the same place. We do need to understand were we stand.\r\rSo in this line, I cannot agree more with you that facilitating tools that allow people to:\r\r1) Be aware of where we are going to if the market does not change, for both companies and consumers. Consciousness activates consumers to new proposals; consciousness activates the market \r2) Be aware of the potential change, if they have never thought about it. Some consumers may not have even thought about this ... and generally speaking absorbing a change and integrating it into a daily life demands time for people (some need more time, others less, but we all need time)\r3) Discuss openly on the advantages and disadvantages of the new model, concerns, issues, etc. This would allow for having on understanding better the starting point.\r\rAnother interesting tool to consider to create the cultural shift is to create a consumer trend. Whether we like it or not, many people do jump on rivers and follow the stream, without really thinking much on where the stream goes, as long as there are certain people in it, they jump. An extreme example: if Barack Obama purchased such service, milions of other would. I understand we should see this as a 'multiplier' factor if we think in terms of Marketing communication campaigns terms. If Barack Obama's slogan is 'Change we believe in', then the green service would also reinforce it's campaign (similar values). \r\rAs for the employees and companies my experience in the consumer electronic sector is that for the some key devices, such as computers, there has been a long-term price battle which have resulted in many manufacturers having their margins absolutely eroded, with more than one even burning money already. These manufacturers should be open and willing to differentiate in order to have their margins back by re-thinking their business model in a way or another. A new proposal to the market, such as this one, which comes with a new cost-model should be at least attractive to them. And for employees the excitement of leading a positive change can result in higher productivity. \r\rIn Spain for instance, in the mobile space, operators have been using mobile device offers to capture new clients. The game has been on for years, but it now appears to be shifting, because smartphones are far too costly, and such business model are no longer feasible. This can also be a door for the new proposal to come into the space.\r\rMy experience also tells me that the best way for employees to absorb a change is by making activities that involve them in creating the change ... so that by the time the change is detailed, they are have already digested it.", "user": "30e4cf98e79ad6962ff3c26a70309578", "date": "August 28, 2012, 10:58AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "responsibility_shift_from_product_based_business_models_to_service_based_business_models", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Yes...

They are just great. On the one hands it shows that there is already a stream going in this direction and trying to find its way, while on the other hand, we see that in other industries the same concept is already a reality. The examples given in the article are just brilliant and they do show very well that the business opportunity is really solving a customer problem (the need for a service) rather than providing them with a device to them that solves it. I am confident this happen sooner or later in the tech industry, and will be a disruptive market opportunity for many.\r\rThe business plan shot you provide is great to kick-off for MOBILE PHONES. It makes me think that the new customer proposal needs to also be taken to the market with a coherent positioning. This are some the points that come to my mind:\r\r- We do not lease phones; we offer a service. For instance we offer 'Calls'+'Email' for X$ a month; or 'Calls'+'Email'+Internet'.\r- The device is branded accordingly. Today, when consumers buy a mobile phone, they choose it in between other reasons for what the statement that the mobile phone does for them. For example, some people want iPhones and not Blackberrys, and the other way around, because if the statement to society the device does. So in our device, the mobile phone should be branded accordingly so that allows a user to state steadily to society, for instance, 'I am environmentally concerned and I choose and accordingly'. Consumers must be proud to show the brand, just as may are proud to say 'I have an iPhone'\r- Channels to introduce this model should also be chosen coherently with its brand positioning, for instance through virtual mobile operators which purely offer services to customers and have never entered into the device-game game.\r\rBy reading your post, I also see more clearly that the figures need to stand out in this model too. And I do think that there is a manufacturing cost opportunity. There is already a lot done in the design industry in this respect, which can be used as a starting point. Have a look at this guide ... it already provides guidelines to do a design ready for diss-assembly, which is really something that this concept needs:\r\rhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQY1VdpHF4c&feature=related\r\rThe difference is that not many of these designs are thought to be commercialized as a service. They are still on the 'device era'. So we can add the next step on it: the service approach. It is really much more feasible that it may appear at a first glance.\r\rBut in any case it is true that the whole value chain needs to be aligned. The business model needs to provide profits to all actors in the chain. On mobile phones, for instance, it means that at least manufacturers and operators work together to build a consumer offer. And within the manufacturing chain the model can go deep into different levels within the chain. I would assume that at a first implementation, we can think the model only goes into the mobile manufacturer and not any further (so, a CPU provider for instance, would remain out of this new model and would continue to operate as it does today).", "user": "30e4cf98e79ad6962ff3c26a70309578", "date": "August 29, 2012, 04:15PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "responsibility_shift_from_product_based_business_models_to_service_based_business_models", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Right on!

A mobile phone for instance symbols something very different from what a printer in a company symbols.\r\rAnd by the way, in the printers industry we have already seen a shift in the business model, which is close to the one we discuss here: HP offers printers under a 'service agreement' as opposed to 'selling the device'; companies just pay an amount for the number of copies / prints, and HP does all the maintenance and upgrades of the machine.\r\rIt seems that in industries where the cost of the device may be a barrier, the change is more likely to happen.

I am really happy to see there is light for this opportunity to create a more conscious manufacturing and consumption pattern. There is nothing wrong with consuming, as long as the whole chain is responsible.\r\rIt is true that the proposal is a bit brave as it encompasses changes on both sides, the manufacturing chain and consumer buying criteria. But then I do think there are symptoms already in both spaces calling for the change, just as we have seen the same symptoms in other sectors (i.e using plastic bags on supermarkets) \r\rEven within the manufacturing chain the new direction would enter into a positive spiral. For example: an OEM such as Intel, could start designing a new CPU that can be easily reused from one device to the next ... therefore long-term durability thinking design criteria could eventually come back into space as it would make sense again as a business driven criteria. In the model that we use today, this criteria does not add value to a business (in the current model as long as a device is sold, that's fine for the business).\r\rAs in many other disruptive market changes, I do believe the change needs to be driven from the consumer request and then all the way up to the value chain. Companies are desperate to cover a market opportunity, so I understand that to make companies open their eyes to this change, an effective tool would be one that shows how there are consumers ready for this, that there are successful cases in other markets with many similarities, and there are also significant cost savings in their manufacturing process (i.e opportunity to make an assembling design chain that allows for easy later device de-assembling to re-use some of its pieces for a new model).\r\rI will think over this to refine it and the questions below, and will certainly go over the links provided.\r\rI take the chance to thank IDEO for this platform.

And I do think it shows very wall how an industry can be re-organised in order to survive in a context where we will run out of natural resources and we cannot avoid anymore the problem generated by mass consumption trash. \r\rThere are a couple of points I think it's worth taking away from it: \r\r1) It states that they realized there was 'very few people wanting  to own the carpet', which is probably a green light to making the business model shift a reality, and to me it probably explains how this model has come to market so early ... and I say 'early' because the same article even states that the carpet is not even marketed as 'environmentally friendly', as it appeared to be an attribute that would put off customers. To me this first point is important as when I did some research for a PC manufacturer back in 2008 we did found out at that time that being 'environmentally friendly' did not seem to be a factor in the consumer's mind when it came to choosing a PC in a shop. This was 4 years ago, and I believe consumers mind may have evolved and have become more conscious of the trash problem. But in any case I understand the way the concept should be marketed should stay away from addressing whose property the device is ... or whether it is a 'sell or lease' model ... to avoid still potential barriers ... it's not so much about a product and how to exploit it (sell vs. lease), it's about a service. Nobody questions whose ownership is a service. I have recently purchase an IPTV service and the Set-Top Box I have been given does not belong to me ... and I hardly even notice this in the process. Why do they do this this way? A Set-top box is expensive so if they sold it, nobody would buy the service. Is the Set-top-box sold as a lease agreement? No. Do I care about what Set-top box they give me? No, as long as it does its function. So to me it's about getting rid of past business frames and focus on value and service.\r\r2) The business model builds on the fact that trash has a value for the manufacturing chain ... and this is something that somebody else brought up in another concept (the marketplace one).

In my opinion, ideas like yours tend to be the most solid and practical solutions to problems like this, where the ultimate level of corporate success is not directly dependent on participation from the masses.  In today's age, it is far too easy for large companies to 'put in their share of the effort' and then leave it to their end users to complete the task (the often disregarded #1-7 recycling symbols exemplify this well, I think).  By initiating a b2b program, you can effectively control a higher level of participation with a more stable and predictable outcome than you might have if you were to deal directly with consumers.  \r\rEvery time a middle man is added to a supply chain, there becomes a marginal profit loss toward the manufacturing end and this can be greatly problematic when dealing with low-value scrap such as e-waste.  Separating, cataloging and transporting e-waste to third-parties is often financially prohibitive, which is why e-waste is such an issue--it doesn't have enough value to begin with in order to warrant that amount of effort.  It is very commendable that you seem to understand that the underlying goal with the e-waste issue is indeed to get e-waste out of the hands of the populous in an efficient manner, such that the number of 'middle men' are lessened; surely, this will maximize potential profit.  In my opinion, creating reverse supply chains (such as those which would tediously deliver scrap electronics back to the original manufacturers) is almost always cost prohibitive. This is why business like used-printer-cartridge purchasers are most often run by third-parties, rather than the initial cartridge manufacturers--the number of middlemen are drastically reduced.  Many US Post Offices offer plastic bags with prepaid postage just for the sole purpose of reducing the middlemen who might otherwise be involved in ink cartridge recycling.  The cartridge goes directly from the end-user to a third party with a relatively small amount of sunk costs.\r\rI am particularly fond of your idea because you seem to have a solid grasp on the fact that targeting b2b groups might really be the way to go here, and I am with you 100%.  Many of the concepts which I have read are more focused on b2c (and even c2c, in some more localized propositions).  Your idea is much like mine in the sense that our concepts can co-exist with non-b2b solutions without causing a large amount of counterproductive competition, which is important when trying to make a maximum dent in the amount of discarded e-waste.  The more feasible (and of course, profitable) options there are to manage e-waste, the more proactive people will be in acquiring and dispensing it.\r\rThe reason why bottle redemption is efficient is simple: there are no middle men.  The entire process begins and ends with the consumer, so there is is no real loss to the consumer--the consumer does not have to pay an additional fee for the service.  Essentially, this type of 'closed-loop' is what it sounds like you are proposing and I have to agree that this exclusivity makes a whole lot of sense.  In terms of planning for a long-term up-start, having a closed circuit of buyers and distributors is probably the best way to ensure that there will ultimately be a profit margin.  It is very respectable that you haven't loss sight of this important facet.  While goodwill does seem to prevail a bit more every year in terms of encouraging pro-Bono recycling initiatives, an industrial-sized operation like yours requires a much larger amount of capital than volunteer-run mom-and-pop recycling centers, but it has the potential to make a much larger impact with lesser overall effort.  With that being said, I think that your closed-loop b2b concept will be able to appeal to potential investors in ways that less-centralized e-waste recycling initiatives could.  \r\rBest of all, I think that your idea (like mine) could attract a more diverse group of investors than most b2c/c2b (and certainly, c2c) operations could.  As much as I hate to lay-down the reality of the situation, large corporations don't generally want to be bothered by minimally profitable initiatives if the incentives show even the slightest amount of risk.  The grand part about your idea, however, is that the more predictable outcome of dealing in a closed-loop means that the types of investors that would normally shy away, might take a second look, simply because the exclusivity lowers the risk for loss.  \r\rDespite a faltering economy, electronics sales are still on the rise.  The fact that your concept could (in theory) allow you to reign control over your own financial infrastructure--whilst maintaining a steady flow of e-waste product coming in--means that your position as the banker in your own economy cannot be spontaneously (or easily) taken away from you.  That notion in itself would undoubtedly tantalize more than a few venture capitalists if you played your card right pitching your proposal!\r\r\r\rAbbreviated notes on terminology for enthusiastic readers...\rPlease don't hesitate to correct me if I am wrong with any of these!  :)\r\r*b2b commerce:  When one business transacts directly with another.\r**b2c commerce:  One business transacts directly with the consumer\r***c2b commerce:  End-user consumer sells to business; ex.

One of the key strategic business issues in this industry is the lack of mines for one of the key raw materials required to produce cement. And what do they do? They are working hard to find the way to recover this material from buildings that are torn down. So they end up buying 'the trash'. We are going to run out of raw resources sooner or later, and we will have to extract those raw resources from 'human manufactured' trash. Some trash will be having an increasing value.

I believe legislation must be enacted and enforced in order to successfully implement. Retailers must add more value and take on the responsibility of accepting recycling returns on behalf of their customers. In order to succeed on a large scale, everyone in the supply and consumption chain must benefit from the program.\r\rAll Consumer Electronics (CE) Products should carry an Eco-rating, similar to the Energy Star rating. This will allow consumers to have a way to evaluate the eco footprint / impact of their purchasing decisions. Much like Energy Star has done, Eco-ratings will also help drive industry wide advances in energy efficiency, material selections, and design for disassembly and recycling. Better Eco-rated products would benefit by having lower deposit 'taxes' added on (as a percentage of MSRP, not 'sale' price) in a given product category. Thus, manufacturers will be financially incentivized to create more sustainable and eco-friendly products.\r\rSo where does the money from the deposits go? Perhaps into federal trust funds collecting interest that in turn are used to cover the costs of managing the program? Also, some of the deposit funds will be needed to refund consumers who return items for recycling.\r\rParticipating retailers (smaller ones can optionally register but participation would be mandatory for major retailers over a certain size) of consumer electronics that register into the federal CE Recycling Program must accept deposit returns of any qualifying product. CE products that don't qualify for deposit refunds should also be accepted for recycling, but no deposit will be paid out. Retailers will pay deposit returns to consumers, and later be reimbursed on a monthly? quarterly? basis by the federal government. Retailers will have to factor the costs of this program into their overhead, which I'm sure will get passed back onto consumers, probably raising prices of goods. This is not such a bad thing, as the low cost of goods is one reason why consumers are so quick to dispose of them, regardless of their actual working conditions. \r\rSo what's the incentive for smaller retailers to register and participate? How about corporate tax breaks for being 'greener' corporate citizens? Also, looking at bottle recycling as a parallel business model, offering a take back service can also drive increases in consumer retail traffic. No one wants to go one place to drop off their deposits and go elsewhere to shop. The convenience factor will give retailers that accept returns and pay deposits a competitive advantage over those that don't.\r\rDid I capture all the stakeholders? Let's see... Consumers? Check.

With regards to this idea (which I very much like) I think it would be effective to first get backing of at least a few big brand names. Perhaps in the implementation stage we can try to see if big retailers like Radioshack would be interested?\r\rBut of course, we would need to convince them and bring them benefits.\r\rFirstly, I think that it is important that we inform key people and communities. I think the \"Life of your Phone\" idea (http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/the-life-of-your-phone/) is a great project to begin informing people. A minimalistic website, interesting, very aesthetically pleasing. Try viral videos, do it KONY style. Also, any college students here? Start awareness campaigns in universities, based on some of the excellent ideas posted already. A student community is often a great place to start, and to galvanize people into action.\r\rWith key people and communities behind us, I think we would have more leverage. For instance, if, say, a student at Stanford were to get the community interested in E-Waste, we may be able to get enough publicity to get to higher corporate powers from our local 'radioshack'.\r\rIf we are able to get corporate interest or even support, we may be able to bring this then to a governmental level. Talk with our local representatives, see what they can do to encourage this.\r\rI think that it is essential that we combine this idea with public, and eventually government support. I agree with Ali that unless we are able to get many companies to do this, it would be difficult to effectively implement.\r\r--\r\rThis is a key step of the overall process. But there are other areas to consider, such as the actual recycling of the E-waste. Who collects the Radioshack waste? Why would they have the incentive?\r\rPascal and my idea talks a bit about this step of the process (http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/golden-e-waste-a-commodity-more-valuable-than-gold-ore/). The concept may shed light onto the actual recycling step of the process and how it may be profitable. In order to provide the generic Radioshack with more than just moral incentive, perhaps we can talk with established recycling companies such as ERIsee how they purchase their e-waste, and how much e-waste we would need have in order for it to be financially feasible to collect.\r\r\rThis is an idea that I would be interested in helping implement.

Rather than take this savings out of the overall cost of the product, I would suggest that this savings becomes an increasingly large rebate for the recycled material. For example, rather than adjusting the price of a smart phone down from $500 to $400 (hypothetical) because it has a refurbished/recycled shell, I would love to see the phone still cost $500 dollars at the outset, but now when the consumer brings it back for recycling he or she could receive $100 + whatever recycling reimbursement was originally offered.

This idea can certainly become as \"everyday\" as deposits are now in some states.  Since reading your concept, I've been thinking about this idea and I definitely want to see it happen sometime soon.  I'm not sure how deep into the details we want to get in the concepting phase but here are some of my thoughts:\r\rThe challenge will be with the implementation, specifically with the retailers.  (Using phones as an example, consumers might be turned off by inconsistencies among retailers. They also won't initially understand the idea that they'll only pay once for all the smartphones they'll ever own, and instead they only see the additional price.)  However, much of the problem could be solved, as has been mentioned, if this is introduced as a law (as opposed to a program one company starts and others adopt).  \r\rSome details remaining to be ironed out would deal with the return of the deposit: Using the soda can deposits model as an example, in Oregon (and I'm assuming elsewhere) certain brands of soda cans (usually off-brand) need to be taken to specific grocery stores in order to get the deposit back.  Translated to this electronics deposit idea, what happens when I purchase a more long-term electronic device that's not so quickly phased out like smartphones (such as a stereo receiver)...and years later I can't remember where I purchased it? Where do I get the deposit?  This problem could be solved by the law, but as experience with the soda deposit law in Oregon shows, not all cans are accepted everywhere, even with a law.\r\rAnyway, I love this idea.

The link Ashley has given you is to an initiative in Colombia in part sponsored by Grameen Institute ( http://www.grameencreativelab.com/ ) who may have some perspectives on this and other similar initiatives.\r\rSo far as I can determine, here in Australia, (with comparatively low volumes), the economics don't yet add up. I think this must be true of most other places too, since e-waste continues to flow into landfill. Whilst recyclers are happy to collect e-waste (and transport it) they are less likely to collect it if it is not free (even if they voluntarily put some profit back into the community). Ascribing value along the return chain would mean less profitability for those currently recycling and reprocessing.\rWe need an economic model that will provide value to the original consumer (or collectors) and the recyclers. To do this we need some means to make e-waste more attractive as a resource than traditional sources of raw materials.\rI don't have any answers (and I'm not an economist) but some mechanism to generate demand for recycled materials would seem appropriate.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "July 27, 2012, 04:32AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "turning_e_waste_into_a_social_business", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hello Paul, thanks for adding! \r\rI have studied some e-waste business models, like in Ontario, Canada (http://www.ontarioelectronicstewardship.ca/), Japan (http://www.aeha.or.jp/) and Europe (http://www.erp-recycling.org/).\r\rWe can see in all these cases that a legislation pressure (fines to manufactures, retailers and importers) and some fostering activities in the first leg of the reverse logistic make the business profitable. \r\rAbout economics, it is possible to see in all those cases that they turned into a profitable activity for recyclers - as manufactures, retailers and importers are responsible for paying the costs. The problem: if they have to pay, the consumer will pay (directly or indirectly).\r\rHere in Brazil we have some cases of companies that are earning money on recycling e-waste - but we also see that many of these companies are not doing it right. There is a huge difference between recycling 80% of a computer and then 20% of it goes to a eco-approved landfill, or recycling 98% of it and just 2% goes to disposal (recycling methods and efficiency). \r\rFor the problem you said about giving value to the collectors (first leg reverse logistic) and then to the recycler (second leg logistic), as the business may be profitable for recyclers, they can pay (and so make a free market) to collectors. In Ontario, each collector receives a pre-defined amount for each ton of e-waste they deliver at recycling centers.\r\rThe e-waste business model is possible, but I still think it could be more: it could be a cause-driven business!

The role of consumer market forces on production is an interesting and complex interchange of profit-chasing, benefits-analysis, and competition.\r\rWhat I didn't see addressed in this video--only skimmed--is the guiding role that big box retailers and superstores play in the flawed product design pathway. This animation seems to point the finger primarily at the product manufacturers themselves. However, so much of the disposable electronics design they create is dictated to them by their partner retailers (think Costco, WalMart, Target, Best Buy), who demand that they provide them with a continual stream of new products each quarter that they can market, which also must span a range of specified price points (ex: $500, $750, $1000, $1300). \r\rFrom the retailers perspective, what we consumers are demanding are new products that give us the latest technology at the lowest initial out-of-pocket cost. So, this means much of the design work comes from walking backwards into retailer marketing schema rather than a rational design plan to produce goods that serve human needs. Keeping up with the assembly line while maintaining a profit margin means that designers & manufacturers cut corners, swap internal components for the cheapest options, and compromise on aesthetics, green design, or usability.\r\rOur solutions should look at ways to educate consumers to demand well-made green products--not just cheap ones--that have longer lifespans.

Bringing the e-waste to gas stations is not a problem because you can normally easily transport the stuff in your car. And: gas stations are everywhere. So the idea is that you can get rid of your e-waste at gas stations which form the contact point for consumers. Depending on how much electronics they bring, they get a  discount on their bill. This could be either by wheight of the e-waste (per kilo) or else. Combine this with some kind of \"Payback-Card\" reward system and people become aware how good they are at reducing e-waste. The collected e-waste can then be used to make oil out of it which is either to be sold at gas stations or the material for new electronic or plastic goods.

Thanks for your post! I was wondering if you have any info you could share on the likelihood that any of the components of e-waste (especially things like heavy metals that may be bad for humans and the environment) incorporated into building materials would leach out of the solid substrate? My hunch is that some materials would likely to be much safer than others and it would be interested to see how the safety properties line up with other important considerations like structural strength, cost etc. ", "user": "e0abda69cce90db2629931ad8fc01106", "date": "July 24, 2012, 03:03PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "don_t_debate_granulate_turning_e_waste_into_rugged_building_materials", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Emily, very nice work!  You seem to know your stuff when it comes to material science!  I completely agree, I think that there are certain materials (particularly in older electronic devices) which could (and would) leech out of the substrate.  Undoubtedly, there is some nasty stuff in electronics, probably too much to list here.  Without going off on a tangent about PCBs, BPA and every other deadly three letter chemical acronym under the sun, I think that you make a very good point.  As I mentioned briefly in my concept, I think that there are certain items which would have to be exiled prior to granulation.  Mainly, I would think that batteries, coolant fluids (especially from computer heat sinks) and large aqueous capacitors (like those from older computer power supplies) could cause problems relating to the safety of the product generated by my proposed concept.  Then again, I think that this is indeed a dilemma which plagues the vast majority of e-waste recycling initiatives.  I suppose for my concept, it is especially pertinent because, as you have mentioned, the product being produced from my idea would be directly in-contact with people on a daily basis.  This undoubtedly propose an issue of public safety, domestic well-being and of course, liability if nothing were to be done to remove certain ingredients from the recipe.  At the same time, however, I do not necessarily think that removing the toxic substances from the mix is prohibitive to the concept.  I think that removal of toxic materials would be completely feasible.  Some of these chemicals could be neutralized in the (pre-resin) powder with the addition of liquids that could target specific compounds, bonding with them on contact (like sodium and chloride for instance--both of which are relatively nasty elements).  I know very little about hazardous materials recovery and management, but I should think that for at least some of the less-desirable chemicals which make it through to the powder (assuming there will be several), the proper combination of conventional and unconventional measures in sequential steps could really do a great deal for materials separation.  I don't have the expertise to really say what types of e-waste should be excluded from the granulation process.  What I can say is the rule-of-thumb that I use when bringing my haz-mat to my local facility: it seems that the more aqueous a substance is, the more likely (and more rapidly) it is to spread a dangerous amount of chemicals into a virgin area.  The way that I see it is this Metals (least concern)-->Plastics and Glues (medium)-->Liquids (highest).  I believe that both the FDA and CDC publicly list acceptable toxicity levels for certain substances, so it would be interesting to try my concept out with low, medium and high levels of care for haz-mat removal and then leave it in the elements for a while and see how it tests on the surface and in a controlled leeching area.

I will have to do some more reading to find out what exactly constitutes a typical glaze to see how feasible this would be.  Off-hand, I would expect that it could be challenging to find a colorizing pigment that would have a broad enough melting range to provide a consistent color among different batches of the e-waste powder 'slurry'.  My thinking is that different batches of powder are going to have melting temperatures which vary widely, depending on the random things that went into those individual batches.  This could be problematic for colorizing pigments that have more sensitive temperature ranges because the pigments might not get hot enough in the kiln, or, in some cases, they might get too hot and lose all of their desirable properties.  It could be the centuries-old dilemma of overcooking the stuffing and under-cooking the turkey, or vise-versa.  Then again, I think that could be a problem with the powder itself too if it were heated rather than turned into a cement, so there will need to be some type of control over the different general categories of the powder if it is going to be altered chemically via melting.

When you lease (or purchase) a car, it generally comes with some sort of a warranty for let's say 100,000 miles. We could extend this model to all electronic goods. You purchase a 2 year license on a new TV for example and the manufacturer will service it within those 2 years you are under contract. Your TV breaks, you bring it back to the manufacturer and get a new one. Your old TV goes back into the waste stream and its usable, functioning parts (which in most cases will be over 90% of the product) go into new TV's. The manufacturer can even offer the same insurance plans that already exist to cover the cost of accidents where the consumer is at fault. This way companies can compete and differentiate themselves on price, innovation and this new model of service. \r\rRobert,\rAlthough it could be cool to remove the lust out of design and the conspicuous consumption of fashionable electronics, I just don't think that is a realistic expectation. Great design and ease of use is one of the biggest reasons why Apple has been demolishing Microsoft over the past couple of years. There is something inherently geeky and technical about lusting over new components and upgrades and I don't think most consumer will buy very much into keeping up with that.

For more tips on how to iterate and prototype your idea during the Refinement phase, check this update on how the shortlist was chosen http://bit.ly/ewaste-top20 and the Lowdown on Refinement: http://bit.ly/oi_refine\r\r(Note: We're currently facing a bug which may prevent you from being able to directly update your concept post. Our developers are busy working on it. Meanwhile, if you're wanting to iterate your ideas, you can use the comments feature to promote further conversation from others. We'll let you know once the bug is fixed, then you can incorporate your refinement moves into your concept post.

It may be \"outdated\" according to your carrier's commercials, but it's got a good amount of memory in it and a good processor.  So someone, with it now being open-source, can create and sell a program for it that will do just that--make it into a media device you can plug into your TV/stereo unit, or your car.  The idea is it would be different than a cell phone--you would leave it where it is most of the time, and disconnect it only when you need to change out the media on it (if it doesn't have something like a mini-usb connection this program could utilize).\r\rIn your home stereo, the once-smartphone can play media from its own memory, or it can connect via your wireless network to a service such as youtube or hulu or netflix or amazon prime or whatever.  These phones have the ability to connect to HD tvs anyway, and its simple (and cheap) enough to convert output from the audio (headphone) jack to a stereo.\r\rIn your car, this could sit in the trunk (where many stereo systems have you put your 5-disc CD changers) the whole time and your car stereo's controls can go through the media (much like they can now with an iphone connected, only you wouldn't have the hassle of having to connect and disconnect every time you get in/out of the car.)  (It's true that this would prevent you from talking on your existing phone through the stereo, but is that feature as commonly-used as the commercials would have us believe?)  If you didn't want it in the trunk, the device has a touch screen and could be used as the stereo, to switch songs or whatever right where your volume control and clock are.\r\rAgain, there are plenty more considerations and details to think through, but here are some more ideas on how to reuse these definitely-not--obsolete devices.", "user": "6314bafcc5d3ce499f3848fa591d4d42", "date": "August 02, 2012, 04:38PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "keeping_older_smart_devices_usable_by_encouraging_the_development_of_fast_software_for_them", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I've also got some ideas on how all of this can work into education, but I'm thinking I'll click the \"build on this\" button on this concept rather than further pollute this space :)", "user": "6314bafcc5d3ce499f3848fa591d4d42", "date": "August 02, 2012, 04:40PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "keeping_older_smart_devices_usable_by_encouraging_the_development_of_fast_software_for_them", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Answering your first question first, GPS doesn't need a data connection.

If you are operating in developing countries with lower wages, where is the e-waste coming from that you will be recycling? If it is domestically is there a high enough level of waste being produced to support your business?\r\r(2) If you are shipping e-waste from the markets that produce the most, how are you off setting the environmental impacts of shipping it from these locations and shipping the recycled materials to the areas that will use them in new products? Where are you considering locating facilities and how does this cluster production and recycling if at all?

From his replies it became apparent that everything has to be done on a very large scale to make it profitable - their 'product' is high grade recycled ABS suitable for feeding back into the manufacturing stream. Clearly they are profitable and partner with metal recovery firms in Britain, Europe and China. I broached the question of downscaling and was informed that they were looking at it from the perspective of pre-processing as it was presently not economic to consider small scale full-function recycling.\r\rAt the moment recycling profitability relies mainly on consumer 'goodwill' - that is goods returned for no cash benefit to the consumer.\rTaking the ERI example a quick check of 2010 shows profit of $10m on turnover of 120m pounds of e-waste (figures from the article you quoted) - converting this to profit per 100g yields a figure of approximately 2 cents. My Samsung mobile phone weighs 108g (possibly including battery which of course is an input cost already factored into the profit).\r\rAt 2c per phone the industry will continue to require 'free' materials for input and there is no real commercial incentive for the consumer in returning goods as recycling raw materials.\rThis is not exactly the outcome I was expecting (or hoping for) when I began the exercise but it is useful to know.\r\rGiven that profitability presently relies on economies of scale the real opportunity lies in developing smaller, more efficient facilities that can compete (closer to their input markets).\r\rLooking at the 'subsidies' raises a whole new range of figures that I will leave for another day.\r\rThanks again for your input and hope to see you in future challenges too.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "August 17, 2012, 01:50AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "golden_e_waste_a_commodity_more_valuable_than_gold_ore", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Paul, I've posted a comment above - what do you think?\r\rRegarding profitability in scale, I agree.

Taking ERI as the benchmark I'm not sure how much information is available on labour as a percentage of operating costs, but if there accounts are public we might be able to do a back of envelope calculation on reported gross labour costs. There is a firm in India that supplies equipment for crushing circuit boards and extracting both ferrous and non-ferrous metals - I'm looking for the link (which foolishly I didn't save). Eparisara is another I just found through your links in the concept (link below). \rAs well as capital cost for that they might provide some idea of the number of machine operators required for various scale operations. Another firm that manufactures plant is Titech ( http://www.titech.com/ ) - I notice they have a presence in China (?Xiamen is Google map reference). Perhaps they too have information on basic manpower required for operation, and they have 'broad statement' descriptions of what the equipment will do. They appear to focus on sorting and separating.\r\rGiven OpenIDEO's suggestions in their congratulatory note and the now short time-frame until evaluation begins I suggest you perhaps expand your process diagram a little to concentrate on dismantling and processing steps perhaps to compare some manual dismantling together with crushing as means of initial separation (see this page for Eparisara ( http://www.ewasteindia.com/processes.html ) where they describe their process - this could be augmented by utilising information from Joe Lee's 'Mint' type concept \r( http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/mint-for-e-waste-management-what-s-my-electronic-footprint/ ) which might provide information on materials in various components that can by-pass the crushing process. Also a possibility to evaluate alternative methods of metal extraction such as bio-extraction \r( http://blueoakresources.com/ ) - especially as this technology is emergent and may be looking for opportunity in developing countries.\r\rThis is another Indian link which is associated with Sims Recycling in USA ( http://www.ewaste.in/F1290/the_process.html )\r\rOn the question of 'pitch' to investors - I have no experience of this but I guess I would rely on the suggestion of lower labour costs and the comparison of e-waste to ore as a source for precious metal. Gold is one commodity that is fairly stable in good economic times and rises in worsening economic conditions.

You'd probably have to be paying this multitalented driver/engineer/educator/recycler a standard if not high salary.\r\r2. Money \rWho pays the salary for the driver? Who pays for the trucks? Who pays for the printing of the pamphlets, the gas used by the trucks, the training of the recyclers? Donations seem unrealistic when this concept is scaled up. Partnerships seems more realistic. Perhaps companies with green inclinationsDell, Applemay sponsor something like this. But if we go for sponsorship, the question of how truly effective this initiative is, what RESULTS it will produce may arise. \r\rI feel that perhaps one possible point to think about is how to make this project itself sustainable. Call me cynical, but I don't believe in altruismespecially when that empty stomach starts growling. For this to be sustainable and scalable, I think that the people involved have to get something more than moral justification for their efforts. Some point down the line, someone HAS to be making money or gaining something.\r\r3. Does this tackle the real crux of the problem? I think a bigger problem that may be considered is what actually happens to the e-waste that is produced. The e-truck will prolong life cycles of electronics (but not prevent the inevitable e-waste production), and collect e-waste. What happens to the e-waste it collects?  Perhaps that is the bigger question.\r\rThis idea is excellent, for informing the community about e-waste is indubitably important. Community and grassroots initiative are super effective. \r\rPerhaps if this idea were implemented in conjunction with a business approach to recycling (http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/golden-e-waste-a-commodity-more-valuable-than-gold-ore/), we could create a sustainable model for taking care of e-waste!!\r\r\r=)\r\r\rFranklyn", "user": "33594d7e6153c4c9703b358ed9198a78", "date": "August 10, 2012, 08:46AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "e_cycle_truck", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Franklyn has linked the golden e-waste concept here which is very relevant, In the article quoted there it has some real figures for recycling which show that profitability in the whole process depends largely upon the 'waste' nature of the product undergoing recycling (i.e. it relies on donation of the product) BUT in the same article it refers to a front end charge applied in some US states that return value to cover cost of collection - since collection is an established part of recycling process the E-Cycle Truck could, in part, be funded through performing both functions.

If you can consider some of these point, then future growth may come more naturally as the boxes and number of chargers/cords grow:\r\r-An electronic inventory system to keep track of the type of charger/cord. People can search by charger/code type or by the product that they are looking to find a cord/charger for (e.g. Galaxy S3 phone, the boxes may not contain any charger for the S3 but they have an S2, which can work). A few of these computers can be set-up around the area. (I know this is looking way down the line).\r\r-The inventory list should also show the location (i.e. the box number)\r\rIn the mean time. I think looking into the design, structure, and organization of the box can be helpful before implementation.\r\r-The optimal box shape and size should be determined through testing and specially designed to hang or organize all the cords/chargers to avoid tangling and to facilitate easy retrieval.\r\r-It would be beneficial to have portal boxes so you can build them up when inventory increases or switch them around based on the environment or when inventory decreases. \r\rHope this helps!", "user": "d910aa696a1fbe9d89fa0f5005c8650b", "date": "September 05, 2012, 02:28AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "chargers_and_cords_exchange_box", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thank you Amy!

The housing market moves more slowly but like automobiles there is considerable residual value and useability in pre-owned houses.\rAt the other end newspapers and periodicals have a very short life-cycle and are often of very low value once superceded.\rPerhaps we have some participants here who can bring background and experience to this concept, which deserves discussing fully.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "August 18, 2012, 05:43AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "buycycle_if_you_want_to_buy_anew_pay_your_due._or_buy_refurbished_instead.", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Paul, thanks a lot for your interesting thoughts. It's a great idea to look at comparable (and non-comparable!) 'product' markets for insights! That hadn't occurred to me at all.\rSince you brought up the automobile industry and the housing market, that made me realize a (maybe) crucial difference here: While with an old house, and even with an old car, people easily know that there is still some significant value in them, that doesn't seem to apply to cell phones for example. The pace of the market is so fast there that people indeed seem to treat their electronic devices very much like newspapers: If they do recycle them, then mostly because they think that they're not worth anything anymore. In the case of the newspapers that may be true, but not so much with electronic devices: It doesn't easily occur to us, that we should _not_ recycle them because they're not worth anything anymore, but _precisely_ because they are still worth _something_! Maybe not to you, maybe not to your neighbor, maybe not to anyone in your neighborhood, but very likely for someone out there who otherwise needs to buy a new or has to do without one. \r\rWith that in mind, two things would need to be done, I guess: a) raise awareness of the remaining value of old devices, and b) provide some market mechanism that directly or indirectly brings together sellers/donators and (re)buyers. Of course, many of all the great concepts here are already striving to do that.\r\rAn upside that I see with the 'buycycle' idea is that it introduces a new kind of 'give and take' principle at the very (temporal) moment in the market cycle, where a) people are already interacting with the market anyway, and where b) they can relatively easily be convinced of the usefulness of (the imposition of) the trade in / buycycling: Since they actively want something, they will be more likely to be okay with making a contribution to the society and the environment (as compared to other moments of trying to 'approach' and incentivize them).\r\rSorry for the slight digression...

While I agree that some residual value will ultimately have to \"come\" (or be derived from) the initial purchase price on the level of economic incentive, I do think that residual value can also come from, or does exist, in other areas as well: precisely because individual and social/environmental value, although somewhat correlated, are not always necessarily identical. \r\rThe challenge is, I think, to make people see those hidden values, and act upon them of course.

Your idea of providing a website for information on what materials go into electronics, what can be re-used and how to safely dismantle and properly recycle certain parts is brilliant!  \r1.    At the point of sale, electronic manufacturers/retailers should  ignite the conversation on the cause by supplying a link that comes with your receipt/ order number on how to re-use/recycle your old item.  One example would be partnering with existing platforms such as: www.earth911.com making E-Waste more visible. \r\rOnce consumers understand why recycling e-waste is important and how it impacts the environment, they will be more prompted to take action.  Here is key to facilitate to them the steps on how to recycle, where to drop off.  \r2.    One idea would be to have a zip code locator at the point-of-sale, where a couple of locations appear as an option to drop off their old electronic.  Also, some manufacturers/retailers or mobile providers are engaging consumers in the cause by offering them 'gift card' credits on new purchase or having a free mailing program available for the old items.  These types of programs should be incentivised or supported by governmental policies. \r\rFinally, once the awareness and the steps on 'how-to' recycle are there, keeping the conversation going through social platforms and having the collaboration of celebrities by sharing their stories (as the\"Hall of Fame\"mentioned above) represent great examples to engage consumers and positively influence them.  \r3.   Sports and pop-culture figures have proved to be 'influencers or trendsetters' - one example is the active model and UN Goodwill Ambassador Gisele Bundchen, who lends her image and fame to several green related cause (http://blog.giselebundchen.com.br/en/geral/iniciativa-para-diminuir-o-efeito-estufa/).

The challenge lies in connector design which serves two purposes:\r1) most importantly the power rating of chargers and adapters needs to match the requirements of the device and designing a unique connector ensures that the device and power source match appropriately;\r2) following from the first point - a unique (and perhaps patentable) connector ensures use of proprietary power sources (including batteries) - leading to the 'need' to buy 'brand' power sources.\r\rFor external chargers and power sources it would be possible to match connectors and power specifications across the industry.\rTo some extent power adapters and chargers conform to a small range of input and output specifications . On the input side the two most common are 240-250 volts and 110 volts representing the two most common domestic sources of power. On the output side the most common seem to be 12v, 9v, 7.2v, 6v 3.5v with currents of about 100ma, 200ma, 500ma, 1amp and 2amp. To cover this range would require about 25 unique connector configurations (there are currently more than this on the market so even extending the range would not be difficult). Another area of standardisation needed in conjunction with this is pin configuration. A two pin connector is usually provided as a female on the charger/adapter end with either inner positive/outer negative or the reverse. If one of these could be agreed as \"the\" required standard that would remove another barrier.\rThe issue is complex but not insurmountable and this concept (adequately marketed) would give impetus to achieving sensible and sustainable standards.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "July 28, 2012, 03:38AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "i_don_t_need_one_more_charger", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "We have a small, manageable range of domestic power plug and socket arrangements around the world, in part linked to the supply rating - similarly we have two common ways of connecting light bulbs to the supply (bayonet and screw) - we can do the same for charger and adapter connections.", "user": "b75f37937882fb4178a3d02f287219c6", "date": "July 28, 2012, 03:49AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "i_don_t_need_one_more_charger", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "This is a great point.

There is definitely a need to identify planned obsolescence in electrical and electronic devices (including things like manipulation of operating systems and the other side of the coin like as you say with software patches and in James Moyer's concept ( http://www.openideo.com/open/e-waste/concepting/keeping-older-smart-devices-usable-by-encouraging-the-development-of-fast-software-for-them/ ))\rHere we have a magazine and website called Choice \r( http://www.choice.com.au/ ) which has a reputation for its fearless independence. I think yours is an idea that organisations like Choice would embrace.\rOften manufacturers don't like unfavourable comparisons but the smarter ones at least tend to fix the identified problems in the next model. Reporting on planned obsolescence and the breaking points (planned or otherwise) might encourage companies to increase the life of products and actually enable them to introduce what the auto industry refers to as after-market enhancements.\r\rTo think about cell phones it is clear that manufacturers have the capacity to apparently quickly respond to changes in network architecture (3G to 4G for example). I reality the network architecture changes far slower than the circuit design changes needed to adapt to them and manufacturers are aware very early of directions the networks are taking. Similarly developments in some hardware like processors and touch screens occur far more slowly than the circuitry and software to take advantage of them - some of this lag time could easily be devoted to enabling existing products to embrace these changes too, even if it means swapping out some components, upgrading memory etc.\r\rIn thinking a little more about this I am reminded of the notion of \"crippleware\" and trial versions (like Microsoft products) that require a tweak (usually involving money) to restore full functionality.

The obvious side effect of the explosion in cheap electronics is the problem of e-waste, and this will go some way to repurposing that.\r\rBut the cheapness of electronics has also made us look at them as disposable and as a means of accessing a service rather than a thing: a drive through window instead of a restaurant. \r\rSo, while in my dads day electronics were an investment and people would learn how they worked, we dont do that anymore. Adding to the example above is the story of William Kwamkwamba. William grew up very poor in rural Malawi with little access to formal education. Nevertheless, he and his best friend would take apart discarded electronics and try to put them back together again, initially for fun but as they taught themselves more as a means of earning some extra money. \r\rThe lessons he taught himself there  and the appreciation he built for the value of experimentation - were to become the foundation from which he grew his knowledge until he had built a fully functioning wind turbine that charged a car battery and powered lighting in his house; making it the first house in the area to have such a luxury. \r\r(http://www.ted.com/speakers/william_kamkwamba.html)  \r\rRead: The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind", "user": "29d1381214d2fe4675526572efdb73ec", "date": "June 20, 2012, 02:16AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "e_waste_workshops_where_people_learn_as_well_imagine_creative_uses_of_e_waste", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Great Share there Brendan!! Thanks!! William's story is so moving. He solved a wicked problem using waste. Amazing example of how e-waste can be used  in such a creative and constructive manner. Brendan can you please post William's story as an Inspiration for this challenge?\r\rI totally agree with you regarding the point made earlier. You are right about electronics designed as disposable items. Annie Leonard labels it as \"designed for dump\". The amount of e-waste generated today is mind-boggling due to this very reason and creative re-ruse will not handle it completely. However, as you said, e-waste can be used to solve social problems as demonstrated brilliantly by Willam's example. A large portion of the E-waste generated today is still completely usable. Recycling prevents them from being used constructively as it again re-enters in to cycle of creating products. Creative re-use channels some if it to a valuable cause i.e. solving social problems.
