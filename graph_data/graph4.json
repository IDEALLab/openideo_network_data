Hadn't considered that external bag color/texture could increase the speed of sanitization. Agree it'd be ideal to price the bag to make it as accessible as possible. However, important to recognize that free may not necessarily be optimum (as discussed in this Harvard Business Review Case Study on developing world condom dissemination: http://hbr.org/product/population-services-international-the-social-marke/an/590061-PDF-ENG ). For example, a nominal price sometimes increases usage, as an indicator of quality and desirability. Also, monetary incentive is important for recruiting local shops/vendors to distribute and promote these bags (though this incentive might be provided through also acting as a used-bag collection point, assuming that enough revenue can be generated through energy/fertilizer creation). Anyways, regardless of the concept, pricing/payment is an important factor that will require much thought.\n@Demian: Yes, it's a huge issue that I'm now much more cognizant of, thanks to openIDEO and the community!\n@Meena: Great link to additional commentary. Very helpful for thinking about further refinement opportunities.\n@Lukasz: Absolutely.

In rapid succession followed agreements with Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Caracas, Venezuela; Brisbane, Australia; and, in the late 1980s, a number of European cities as well as Hong Kong.

A concern for me is that giving the incremental responsibility to residents might raise a lot of questions and lead to neighborly tension.  For example, do people with longer stretches of drain in front of their house get paid more and, if so, who decides that?  Do people upstream have an advantage over people downstream in that they could just push the waste in their drain towards their downstream neighbor?  Would people complain that their neighbors are not cleaning their portion of the drain as well as they are but are still getting paid the same amount?

School supplies, uniforms and scholarships for children to attend school encourage aspirational behavior in a way that simple cash payments don't.These non-cash benefits are much less likely to be appropriated by others as well.The distribution of these rewards can also be structured in ways that discourage envy (by including the family and community in benefiting from each person's appropriate sanitation) and reduce the possibility of theft and resale (e.g.:storing school supplies at school except the ones in immediate use) In an area so full of poverty, it's important to reward people in ways that don't end up with them being victimized by criminals or abusive family members. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "user": "299453c107788839f427a6169f591ac4", "date": "January 05, 2011, 07:01PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "preventative_medicine_reward_sanitary_practices", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for the comment Alessandro!  Yes, it is a similar concept to Vincent's \"Get Paid For Your Poop\".

My concept is is a proposal to overturn the current pay-per-use equation, incentivizing people to use the public toilets which would then keep feces from contaminating open areas and water sources.  The main purpose of this being to maintain good public health.  Less feces contaminating the environment would prevent the outbreak and spread disease.  The less disease in need of treatment, the less government and international health aid workers and supplies are needed.  Thereby saving a lot of money in the long run.  So much of our spending for healthcare is reactionary and treatment based.  It might be much more cost effective, and much cheaper, to look at public health from a prevention perspective.

Maybe get at the point that people need not spend anything to get rid of their manure. If we get to equilibrium between revenue and expenditure, would be perfect.

Yes, thinking about the sanitation problem in relation to telephone communication infrastructure.  The problem with telephones that developing countries were dealing with only a few years ago was that of the expense of stretching telephone lines over great distances to reach only a small number of people.  This issue was overcome with the utilization of cellphone technology.  Now individual node cell towers could be installed more or less where they were needed and reached by satellite, thereby eliminating the need or the expense of running phone wires over long distances to connect the dots.The sanitation problem in some way feels the same.  With a lack of infrastructure to transport the waste over the long distance of the 'network', the most efficient solution would then be to install single nodes of sanitation processing where it is needed most.  Who knows, maybe these small sanitation processing nodes could be engineered so that their capacity could be added to in series as small scale waste drainage infrastructure organically branches out from the public facilities.  Priority might be to provide waste processing capacity to the nearby clinic, public school, etc.To think about waste processing in terms of nodes of organic growth may be a very viable way to develop this infrastructure.

In 2007, a price of $7 per 1,000 cubic feet (28 m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per gigajoule. In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1,000 cubic feet (28 m3) ($10/MMBTU).[39] The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12$16 per 1,000 cu ft (28 m3).[40] Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000 MMBTU (~10,550 gigajoules), or 10 billion BTU. Thus, if the price of gas is $10 per million BTUs on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas\nSo 0.6 cubic meters of gas roughly equals $0.32. \n550 litres or urine and feces would weight around 550kg which would equal 1210lbs which would roughly give 0.7 cubic meters of buiogas which would roughly give $0.40. This is the average value of a years supply of sewage from one person given that human waste as defined by David House is urine and feces if not this number is roughly a tenth of that so $0.04. \n\nOuch!\nThe $0.04 is probably more accurate as urine probably won't be collected.Can economies of scale make thias a viable job for someone. What is the average wage in some of the third world countries we're looking at?\nI'm late for the cinema!

The daily practice of pooping in open fields, on river banks, etc, typically considered an objectionable 'duty' and something to be shunned, could instead be seen as a renewable resource with great potential to be harnessed and utilized.  If the experience were organized just a little, I think public perception could be transformed.  Addressed from a slightly different angle, daily defecation of communities could be neutralized and used instead of left to pollute the ground and waterways.  With minimal setup, open field poop dumps could be 'rebranded' as farms.  Farms that benefit from the continual 'delivery' of fertilizer to grow plants that supply fibers or building materials to the community.  Imagine a row of outhouses on a wheeled platform positioned over a grid of shallow holes or trenches.  As people use the outhouses and fill the holes, the outhouses are then rolled a short distance to the next line of empty holes.  As noted above each used hole is treated and plants shoots are added.One of the main benefits of rebranding the entire defecation experience might be that the people employed in the human waste removal industry could be recast as 'farmers' instead of outcasts or untouchables.  This is a huge problem in societies that stigmatize certain types of work and shun the people that hold those jobs, relegating them to a lower class or caste.  If we are to overcome these issues, one way of addressing the problem could be to speak about the work in a positive way, as something necessary and vital to the community and it's well being.Another benefit might be that the use of the 'farm' facilities would be free.  The farming operation would welcome the fertilizer and could make money from the sale of the harvested building or textile materials.Speaking of the plants, I mentioned bamboo as an example of a plant that is not eaten (mature varieties anyway) but that is fast growing and useful as a building material or source of fibers.  But you are correct in that several different plant species could be farmed depending on the farm's location and indigenous plant life.Thanks again, Sabra, for your thoughtful comments!", "user": "7c8e822d3f154bb2b046f6e1085eea54", "date": "December 29, 2010, 11:11PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "rebrand_the_experience_and_capitalize_on_the_resources", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "I love the idea of a moving latrine, first dug then filled then moved.

Our own food and body waste can provide a source of clean power as part of the process of making it into safe compost which is perfect food for the soil.Everybody wins. I love the concept of going with existing behaviors. I imagine myself going out to the ditch/bank/field to defecate as people have been doing for generations untold and I feel the logic of it in my bones. We just have to adjust how people are doing it slightly, not where. Pit planting bamboo sounds good, although I have to wonder if there are native plants with just as much fiber potential we could be planting too or instead.Banana also comes to mind because of the many uses of the leaves and roots and how much shade it provides.I love the potential of bamboo as a building material. You can make really nice portable shelter, furniture, even paper and cloth from bamboo. You can do most of these with other fiber crops, but its potential as poles is unmatched.Responsibly designed above grade(so it can't spread) bamboo farms with planned harvest could produce large amounts of timber, tool handles, fiber or whatever really fast.Bamboo is a super invasive plant. To live with it, you pretty much just have to be picking all the shoots growing in directions you don't like. People who live in bamboo areas usually eat them. This would obviously not be an option for bamboo grown in human manure pits. Unchecked, it spreads and thickens, sucking up all the water it can, eventually crowding out most other life, including human.Clippings could be composted, but require ongoing labor input to maintain and prevent encroachment.Any area successfully planted in bamboo will never be available for any other use. Bamboo is permanent unless drought is so bad everything dies, and it spreads everywhere it possibly can.Where will people defecate 5 years from now? On the ground in between the bamboo clumps, because it's not possible to move an established bamboo clump or dig through its roots without heavy equipment or insane amounts of human labor with hatchets and saws. Eventually(10 years from first planting in a bamboo friendly place) there won't be room to site new latrines in between the root clumps.Harvesting poles has to be done very neatly, or the stump becomes a spear to the unwary foot. This is just what you don't need where shoeless people defecate.I've only lived around bamboo groves a little bit in Austin , Texas. That was enough to teach me not to go barefoot in areas where people have been cutting bamboo haphazardly. I asked a woman from the Philippines who grew up in a bamboo forest area how people kept from injuring their feet on the bamboo. She said people got hurt all the time and often got infections from the puncture wounds as well. She also said her parents taught her how to be careful and how to treat her injuries to prevent infection. Bamboo is marvelous stuff, but if you don't have the traditional knowledge to make it an acceptable neighbor, it can cause more problems than it solves.I'm very sorry this is so very long.Thanks for your patience to anyone who actually finishes this \"comment\". \n", "user": "299453c107788839f427a6169f591ac4", "date": "December 29, 2010, 11:02AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["community_infrastructure", "services", "awareness"], "comment_count": 8, "title": "Rebrand the Experience and Capitalize on the Resources", "evaluations": null, "type": "concept", "id": "rebrand_the_experience_and_capitalize_on_the_resources", "applause": 3}, "smear": {"description": "How can we equip/educate people to smear + keep hands clean?\r\n", "views": 626, "creator": "f19c9fa069ffbf940afc53c378818dfc", "url": "http://www.openideo.com/open/how-can-we-improve-sanitation-and-better-manage-human-waste-in-low-income-urban-communities/inspiration/smear", "image": "http://www.openideo.com/open/how-can-we-improve-sanitation-and-better-manage-human-waste-in-low-income-urban-communities/inspiration/smear/gallery/poo.jpg/", "created": {"py/object": "datetime.datetime", "__reduce__": [{"py/type": "datetime.datetime"}, ["B9oLHAE6AAAAAA=="]]}, "comments": [{"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "smear", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Vincent,\"Smearing\" is an often taught backcountry no-trace camping skill.

Water in, water out...One stop shopping makes for less trips=more time for other things in life.Capturing rainwater also aids sanitation in urban areas by reducing runoff into streets, streams and rivers. Water from people washing themselves and their clothes can also be used to irrigate crops, further reducing runoff, and creating another source of livelihood for people in the area.If you maximize the potentials for generating revenue and social capital from the sanitation process you can leverage all sorts of other positive changes that impact quality of life.Human waste is the most undervalued resource on the planet. It is also among the most abundant, and therefor cheapest. People will actually pay you to take it away...\n\n", "user": "299453c107788839f427a6169f591ac4", "date": "December 10, 2010, 08:33AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "challenges_around_water_access", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Even if there is a waterless toilet (think moldering privy) the users might enjoy a refillable water spray can for that extra touch of luxury - there's lots of space here for bottom-up innovation:) ", "user": "cb0e09c205b2413162b95a8b79401432", "date": "December 08, 2010, 06:09PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "challenges_around_water_access", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Good point about the potential limitation of water accessibility Meena.

He/she will then be switched to a clean toilet and avoid any potential charges, while the unclean toilet is automatically locked. Then the previous user (who left an unclean toilet after use) is only charged when the maintenance worker arrives and verifies that the toilet is unclean. Phone #'s that have too many false reports, or too many cases of not cleaning the toilet after use, could also be automatically banned from the system for a set period of probationary time.

The one issue I could see with that model would be that there might be a lot of disputes from people who were charged but protest that they actually cleaned the toilet after their use.  Maybe to minimize the disputes the on-sight bathroom attendant verifies that the room is clean before the person that just used it leaves.  That way, if there is an issue with the state that it is left in it could be resolved right then and a penalty cleaning fee would not be subtracted from their account.

As public pay toilets are already staffed by caretakers/cleaners, this would hopefully increase the # of toilets that can be maintained by each person.\nAlso, building user toilet maintenance norms can begin even without an immediately implemented text-messaging service, as I explain in this related concept: http://bit.ly/ebfxYs", "user": "b15ab3f829f0f897fe507ef548741afb", "date": "January 10, 2011, 02:40PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "texting_toilets", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "I really like this concept.

If composting or dehydration of the stool are made on the spot, really interesting is the separation of feces and urine. I understand that in your project, the urine is separated from feces by a gravity system. This can be a problem if the objective is to make urine as fertilizer, because if the urine initially traverse the same path of feces, it will certainly be contaminated. The system of sanitary bowl separator with urine and feces is a success in several countries... why not adopt it, if the objective really is the separation? It's a small problem for men, but they urinate in a urinal. In this system, urine has a low rate of contamination, and can easily be used as fertilizer. Iffinal objective, however,is adigester would not be a problem mixing it all! In reality it is much easier to transport vacuum system.If the objective is to reduce costs, imagine it's cheaper to build bathrooms that are only temporary reservoirs that composters complete. I think that composting centralized in one location would be less expensive. This also reduces the size of the bathrooms.

The point of the mobile dairy was to move the location of the waste every week or so, so that there wasn't a pile in one area, but it was evenly distributed over fields. That is, because they wanted to use the waste as fertilister.  Not that I think moving human toilets is a particularly good idea... but for the sake of the process --- throwing new ideas up, I will add it :)", "user": "6eeccddf3b9b80413f1442ec630397df", "date":
