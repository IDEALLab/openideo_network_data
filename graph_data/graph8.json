There are few brands that have been successful in that region, one of them is the mother of some one I study with in school.

Their brand is called Cafe Quindio (http://www.cafequindio.com/home.html) they all ready have small coffee shops, they are building a museum, etc. Another brand that is getting strong Cafe San Alberto (http://www.cafesanalberto.com/) I need to say that is one of my favorite places in the region, their coffee shop is at the top of the mountain and it has a view to the valley, is magical. Cafe DelParaisso (http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_145028942212163), is a new brand that just stared, is an organic coffee made by young people. All of the above are people that have their coffee brand and they are commercializing themselves. \r\rTheir is also a really popular contest that takes place in el Quindio (the town next to Caldas) that is called \"The Best Cup of Coffee\" (http://www.revistalabarra.com.co/news/57/112/QUINDiO-CAFe-Y-SABOR-SE-PREPARA-PARA-SU-TERCERA-VERSIoN-EN-ARMENIA.htm). How it works is that they try the coffee from all the local brands, specially that ones that have small coffee farmers who are building their brand and coffee shop, then they will decide which one will be the best one. In my opinion, it had made a big impact for the participant. This put them out there and also in my experience being from that region we are all waiting to hear who is the winner to go and drink the best cup of coffee.

I think theres a huge potential targeting Colombians abroad. Not only because they definitely miss their coffee -which is a fact, but also and primary because of the cause.  Help their own people moves and gather Colombians around the globe most of the times. A good example was El Salado campaign. It was promoted by a famous radio station in Colombia (La W) and through the station and different websites people could afford a bracelet which money was used to re-build El Salado a small village which suffers a terrible massacre a year ago. Most of the bracelets were bought by Colombians abroad.

It would be enough to have a good bl/w-copier, to copy 2-5 sheets, manually fold them and put a staple or paperclip to keep the pages together. ( Make sure with the graphic design to have notices on front page and the last page that the next issue could have a different design or size, so that people are prepared that this will be upgraded depending on its success rate )\rAlso use small empty spaces to ask for readers to contribute with text, illustrations, paintings, cartoons, crossword puzzles and so on...\rAll that contribute with content will be able to be recruited as a reseller in their area. So after a couple of months they would be able to get some fees for the published content.\r\rYou would not need any web design or translation at first.\rJust make a pdf-version, (place it in docs.google.com or any other magazine-freebie-pdf-service that exists online issuu.com and similar) leave it in spanish and do not change anything. Let the international readers get it all, they can choose what stories are interesting to read. Just make many volunteers in caldas contribute with content, and you will get readers. Mouth-to-mouth-rumours will be able to spread the CSBTimes pdf. Marketing and Distribution could be simple, start a group in spanish on facebook and email a message to some people with a link to where the PDF is available online, and tell them to share the link on their facebook if they like it. (i guess there are a pdf-reader for iPads and smartphones that could make them pay a small fee for each pdf they download)\r\rBut in the simplest version just make its first weeks/month for free, at least the first 4-5 issues. but make ads in it, that very clearly states it do appreciate donations, to pay for continous work on writing articles and enlarging the paper-version... and if they receive enough donations they can keep the pdf-distribution for free.\r\rYou would get a lot of readers that continues to watch it for free, and not donates anything. but you could also make them www.paywithatweet.com\r\rYou could also with ads in the magazine \"crowdsource\" international volunteer translators, into english and other languages if needed. (peer-reviewed to be sure that at least 2-3 persons checked the same article, for quality reasons)\r\rAlso a big benefit of having a pdf, is it will be possible to email to different internet cafs in all villages through out Colombia, to make them print copies to have for sale and build a small distribution network, so you will remove most costs for stamps and delivery and the administration gets decentralized.\r\rYou could also apply a sort of recycling-model, if a reader brings back his copy from last month to the salesperson he gets a discount.\r\rBut i guess that some readers would want to save their issues for longer, and to collect them, particularly if they know someone that have sent in an article or illustration.\r\rI hope that some of my ideas will spur this concept further along the low-cost and smart-scale... just ask if you got further questions. :)", "user": "656863f55543ea22d1dbce290f237277", "date": "July 02, 2011, 10:32AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "the_caldas_social_business_times", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Great point that the printing could be as simple as photocopying initially  making the venture much easier to get off the ground while interest is being gauged.

Love the concept. I've joined the conversation late, so I hope my comments may still be of value, if they haven't been raised earlier.\r\rIn Pakistan, my colleagues and I were involved in setting up an interactive voice recorded version of what you describe. Perhaps some aspects of what we did and learned there would be of interest for your concept (and its potential implementation).\r\r1. One of the advantages of using voice recordings is that it overcomes literacy and numeracy challenges that may prevent some of your intended audience from accessing the information.\r\r2. The content and its \"packaging\" is key to getting your intended audience to try it. We used a prominent female TV personality who is also a medical doctor to be the voice of the content and the face of a campaign. This gave the service credibility but also helped to make the service more entertaining.\r\r3. Consumer education is critical to take it beyond trial. Our data indicated that initially many callers had difficulty navigating the menu.\rWe used billboards, local radio and community health volunteers to promote and demonstrate the service to address this.\r\r4. If sufficient demand is created for the service, it may become a viable business model. \"Packaging\", promotion and consumer education are your biggest costs, in our experience. Beyond that, the service can be maintained at low cost.

In a lake in africa it was introduced a foreign species of fish as a new \"profitable\" food source, and this new fish ate almost all of the local species and took over, so this fish became so expensive that it is almost only european and russian fish markets that can afford to buy it.

Would like to share.\r\rA Resource Based Economy (RBE) is a sustainable social design that advocates intelligent management of the earths resources, humane application of technology and automation, and equitable practice of the scientific method, in order to create abundance and enable holistic love-based evolution of the human race.\r\rRBE is an antidote for the corrupt profit-oriented society we live in today. It focuses single-mindedly on applying the scientific method for the good of all mankind. All understandings are based on logic, not opinion, and are constantly updated to present-day knowledge. All social systems such as energy, architecture, transport, education, research, recreation, etc., are derived from a thorough scientific, environmental and social understanding of all phenomena. This methodology is derived from the critical observation that people dont need money to survive, rather they need the resources bought with money in order to live a healthy, happy and civilized life. RBE can create abundance and eradicate the concept of scarcity altogether  by declaring all the earths resources as common heritage of all the earths people, removing borders and false divisions, and using technology to abolish repetitive human labour. In RBE, there is neither any need, nor any room for scarcity, corruption, poverty, hunger, conflict, war, crime, prisons, riots, or any other fear-based evil we see in society today. Instead of offering temporary solutions for these symptoms (social evils), RBE treats the very root (scarcity and fear). Through sensible and ethical use of science and technology, RBE can deliver a life of abundance for each of the 7 billion people that inhabit the world, for multitudes of generations still to come, and for the ecosystem they call home.", "user": "f53927b33d0de8bacd6b56113886715e", "date": "June 23, 2011, 05:03AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "redefine_comunity_farming_share_cropping", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "sounds to good to be true.

It implies a central power that decides on everything, but fails to describe its workings. So, to me, the RBE-idea is based on a very small elite that has full control over resources and humanity and aims to feed the people a story without giving transparency on the control mechanism. Which makes it prone to the same challenges it aims to solve: the struggle for control over scarce resources.

A brilliant inspiration.\r\r'Decentralized Operation'\rI think that one of the biggest problem with the current manufacturing and distribution system is centralization. Mostly with food, farmers transport their produce to a central market and then it goes to the wholesaler and then to the retailer and finally to the consumer. A bag of rice or potato or peanut or grains grown in a region which the consumer lives in, has to travel 100s of miles before it reaches back to the region. It uses extra resources, it looses its freshness, it gets damaged and takes multilayer packaging for such distribution. Fruits specially are plucked unripened and then has to be sprayed with chemicals to ripe them before it reaches the end user. It might not make sense to national GDP or MNCs but it makes lot of sense to local economy and makes lot more sense to our planets health.\rWe should look into ways to get back to farmer's market, coop stores, Community Supported Agriculture to empower local communities.\rI believe that whats known as the bottom of the pyramid is actually the foundation of any society, culture and economy. If we take out the bottom slice of the pyramid, all the top slices can crumble in no time, we should rather start looking all the slices like a cake slice where no one is above anyone and all the sections of society are treated equality and fairly.\rA farmer should get same if not more out of his 1 kg rice profit compared to his dealer.

But what I believe is, that we should think about how to generate wealth, I do not believe that huge financial investments always have a larger impact on any social or environmental cause.\rWith wealth generation, what I am trying to share here is, we should be looking into primary production. Production from resources, natural and human resources.\rFor example, food production. One seed cost almost nothing, but that seed produces 1000s of seeds, that plant wont need money to grow, all it needs is soil, water, nutrition and little care. And all this we can manage without financial investments. All we need is a good management of resources (I personally believe that the only reason we are here discussing about social business is because in the last couple of centuries, we have only learned how to Mismanage our resources.)\rI also believe that every such communities are basically a farming community, they still earn their living by growing something and selling it to markets. So they do not have to start from scratch, all they need is a brief introduction to sustainable farming practices and smart use of natural waste. Introducing high nutrition plant varieties can show results in improving their health in less then 2 months. And other varieties of food and grains can generate income all year around, regardless of climate conditions and rain. The most important thing is to find the right kind of plant species for that specific region. And there are species of plants and grains which are drouth resistance, flood resistance, pest resistance, frost resistance, temperature resistance, climate resistance... you name it we have it. \r\rhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault\r\rSeed Funding is a term used commonly, and it does make lot of sense. All we need to generate wealth is a healthy seed, and then nature does the rest.\rSocial Business is a holistic concept of exchanging goods and services, and I strongly feel that all social business should have holistic approach considering nature as our biggest asset.\rPlease feel free to comment and share your views!\rThank you all for participating in Social Business.", "user": "f53927b33d0de8bacd6b56113886715e", "date": "June 22, 2011, 05:56PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "social_business_social_mission_financial_sustainability", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Adding more to it which I read recently!\r\rA Resource Based Economy (RBE) is a sustainable social design that advocates intelligent management of the earths resources, humane application of technology and automation, and equitable practice of the scientific method, in order to create abundance and enable holistic love-based evolution of the human race.\r\rRBE is an antidote for the corrupt profit-oriented society we live in today. It focuses single-mindedly on applying the scientific method for the good of all mankind. All understandings are based on logic, not opinion, and are constantly updated to present-day knowledge. All social systems such as energy, architecture, transport, education, research, recreation, etc., are derived from a thorough scientific, environmental and social understanding of all phenomena. This methodology is derived from the critical observation that people dont need money to survive, rather they need the resources bought with money in order to live a healthy, happy and civilized life. RBE can create abundance and eradicate the concept of scarcity altogether  by declaring all the earths resources as common heritage of all the earths people, removing borders and false divisions, and using technology to abolish repetitive human labour. In RBE, there is neither any need, nor any room for scarcity, corruption, poverty, hunger, conflict, war, crime, prisons, riots, or any other fear-based evil we see in society today. Instead of offering temporary solutions for these symptoms (social evils), RBE treats the very root (scarcity and fear).

In fact, some governments expect you to report big interest-free personal loans as a gift (based on a calculation of the market-rate interest) for taxation purposes.\r\rHowever, there are some important differences between a simple donation & interest-free loans, including 1) by lending out money you expect to be returned, you are likely to commit more than you'd be able to through a donation, thus increasing the supply of capital available for pursuing social good, 2) psychologically this feels very different for both the lender & lendee (i.e. it's a hand up, not a hand out), & 3) the loan principal in an interest-free loan is often actually at risk, which is nonexistent factor for a donation.\r\rAs for differentiating between various terms like Type II Social Businesses & Cooperatives (or Social Business vs. Purpose-Driven Business vs. Sustainable Business vs. Socially Conscious Business, etc.), it's possible to draw out distinctions, but I think the important thing is just to be aware of the diversity of potential options and then design something that works best for a specific scenario.

I say, as long as you're making a difference, call it what you want =P", "user": "b15ab3f829f0f897fe507ef548741afb", "date": "June 21, 2011, 04:01PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "social_business_social_mission_financial_sustainability", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Vincent, excellent points!

This is exciting!\r\rI am not sure I can define \"exactly\" what these activities are but I'll give it a try.\r\rThere is an assumption: when living in poverty life is sustained on a daily basis. \r\rTherefore, increasing the efficiency of the day will exponentially impact the quality of life.\r\rThis means that everyday you look, find and lose a job. Everyday you go shopping for food, goods and medicine. Everyday you consume everything you buy. Everyday you start again from zero.\r\rI am calling \"parallel activities\" all those that do NOT add direct value to the families. \r\rOn the other hand, I am assuming that \"value creation activities\" are those activities that, as they are performed, they increase the quality of life of the individuals.\r\rActivities that add value (i.e.):\r- Working: you make money.\r- Studying: you learn.\r- Eating: you gain energy.\r- Sleeping: you make energy and knowledge available to yourself.\r- Connect with love ones: you build a sense of belonging and connect through values.\r\rActivities NOT adding value (i.e.):\r- Looking for job: to find a job is valuable but \"looking for\" can be very time comsuming and with very low conversion rate. \r- Shopping for food, medicines, services: getting the right things at the right price is great but \"looking around for\" doesn't mean you will find them.\r- Commuting: some people walk/bus up to 2 hours to get to the city, the school or their work place. Imagine what they could do with this time! \r- Lining up for social support: 10 people in a line for 1 hour is ridiculos, in Latin America you can spend 2-3 days to get paper work done if you are not \"highly skilled\" (if you don't read/write Spanish).\r\rWhat excites me the most is that once these \"not adding value activities\" are mapped out and weighted based on relevance to the local community, you can easily come with some crazy ways to make positive impact.\r\rCheck it out:\r\r- If you commute 45min each way to work, you could take two lessons daily on any subject by radio, by mobile phone, by book, in group... People could learn to write/read, basic maths, conversational English, health during pregnancy, HIV prevention, nutrition, family planning...\r\r- If 5 families are enabled to organize themselves for shopping, they could buy more, faster, cheaper and with credit from each other. A few more hours of work per week, a few mor cents saved!\r\r- Looking for job: we could support them creating \"cooperativas de servicio\" with a few well selected stuff we could triple (or more) their conversion rate and they will be working much more time than now.\r\rI'm sorry for the long comment, It's a pop corn machine that sometimes takes over :) I hope it makes sense!", "user": "7b76fa6d63e8b83256c530bed4c855e1", "date": "June 24, 2011, 09:40AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}], "themes": ["women_children"], "comment_count": 2, "title": "Latin American poverty has a woman's face", "evaluations": null, "type": "inspiration", "id": "latin_american_poverty_has_a_woman_s_face", "applause": 4}, "please_help_me_not_feel_pretentious": {"description": "I have great difficulty seeing how I can add something to the Caldas issue while sitting in my comfy office: I wouldn't even try to pretend I could develop a good solution for a group of people from my own country with some internet surfing.", "views": 493, "creator": "54c27730bcd2b587aa9c4ff8cc83c3e2", "url": "http://www.openideo.com/open/how-might-we-improve-health-care-through-social-business-in-low-income-communities/inspiration/please-help-me-not-feel-pretentious", "image": "", "created": {"py/object": "datetime.datetime", "__reduce__": [{"py/type": "datetime.datetime"}, ["B9sGFQkOAAAAAA=="]]}, "comments": [{"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "please_help_me_not_feel_pretentious", "applause": 6, "user_url": "", "text": "Koos, you are right that we need perspective from actually being there and on the ground to design an optimal solution that truly works for the people of Caldas.

The momentum/fear of selling-buying is gone. And for the consumer freedom of choice is gone as maybe next door the quality is better... Can't have that as you ordered already. \r\rControl of all the farms is not an option costwise. And if the quality of a farm is not ok one year, you could kick him out of the system, but that doe not ensure you the new farmer will deliver quality.\r\rSorry for this long thread!!!

For example, in 2003, NSDF and Mahila Milan joined forces with local police in Pune and, one year later, Mumbai to create the innovative Slum Police Panchayat Scheme.  The scheme involves a local police officer working with 10 sahayaks or helpers (predominantly women) from a slum to assist in maintaining the peace and order in these settlements.  The sahayaks, who are selected by communities themselves, try to  resolve disputes within settlements without having to bring in outside help or resort to the formal legal system.  This new partnership helps build trust between government, police and slum dwellers and reduces the amount of time law enforcement officials spend in slums trying to patrol the complicated maze of informal structures.  In September 2004, Mumbais Commissioner of Police presented the pioneering Slum Police Panchayat Scheme to attendees of the World Urban Forum; since then the scheme has been scaled-up greatly.\r\rhttp://www.mumbaipolice.org/initiative/initiative_2004.htm\r\rObviously the scale of crimes in Colombia may very well be different, esp if it includes paramilitaries as you said.

I think the Bolivia case study is pretty similar to what you could envision to happen in Caldas. A few problems that will need to be tackled though:\r- I am not sure whether Colombia or the specific region of Caldas has an established credit bureau. This is a sine qua non condition to giving away any types of loans, both because of the risk of high delinquency / non-repayment rates, and because it could harm the borrowers themselves (risk of overindebtedness).\r- The operational costs of managing the loans and monitoring repayments on a regular basis might be higher than you think. I don't know if you envision the loans to be given to individual farmers, or to a cooperative, or a bigger type of association, but the more borrowers you have, the more expensive (VERY expensive) it can become.\r- There should be some sort of 'contract' in order to make sure the lended money will serve to buy lands, and not something else. In a lot of countries, rural farmers are known for being too tempted to spend their agricultural loan money right away, and not necessarily towards productive ends. In some cases, in Malawi for example, the agricultural loans have been couples with commitment savings products in order to help educate the farmers that it's way more beneficial for them in the long term.", "user": "e42683996625a90919063543481b8f3b", "date": "July 11, 2011, 02:43PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "think_regionally...hack_locally", "applause": 2, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Sarah,\r\rDeeply appreciate your informed feedback.  I am familiar with some of these hurdles that are typical of such enterprises.  The CGAP research is prefaced with examples of numerous failures and the existence of only a few successes.  That said, there are some helpful lessons that may be carried over from the successful precedents, granted that we keep contextually specific variables in mind.\r\rI agree that overindeptedness is a huge problem (as we have seen with microfinance in general), therefore a strict approval process would be necessary.  Loan recipients would likely be farming coops, where multiple families manage a collection of parcels.  This would serve two purposes: to avoid the problem of awkwardly small tracts that cannot yield profitably, and to diversify the risk amongst multiple stakeholders (contractual obligations within the coop is yet another planning issue, yet models exist to build on). Additionally, education and apprenticeship would need to be a huge part of this idea (maybe this is actually the vehicle to land ownership instead of the bank... okay new concept :/).  A successful farmer requires just as much wisdom and experience as they do education, and therefore it may be necessary for a certification program to be completed as a prerequisite to loan approval.\r\rMicrofinance providers would need to complement their agricultural portfolio with other loan products (such as mortgages, and business loans), to reduce institutional risk and provide more robust operating margins.  The operational costs may be ameliorated with the above, or as in the case of Bolivia:\r\rThese rural offices do not lend exclusively to rural clients; so, the lower cost of lending to clients in town, combined with the slightly higher interest rates charged for agricultural loans, helps cover the expense of lending to clients in more isolated areas. The\rcautious provision of some consumer credit to salaried employees also helps offset agricultural lending expenses. \r\rSource: Emerging lessons in agricultural microfinance, IFAD 2006\r\rAdditionally, as with the Bolivia case, loan officers would need to have a background in agriculture or agronomy, and have substantial knowledge and experience living in the area.  This knowledge of the region, its micro-climates, seasonal production cycles, and labor flows, has proven to substantially increase the likelihood of repayment as sited by the successful cases.  And, regarding contracts to limit loan awards spent on things other than agriculture, I think here you are right-on to suggest a contract.  Many of the cases employed comprehensive audits of potential recipients to evaluate projected agribusiness related expenses as well as household expenses.  Such household assessments helped to identify where an individual recipient may be tempted to use the loan award for expenses unrelated to agribusiness.  But, a contract might be a helpful line of defense to mitigate irresponsible spending.\r\rI will incorporate some of these thoughts and responses into the concept to make it more clear.

Do you envisage each farmer defining their own kinds of coffee (organic, bean consistency, processing consistency, etc.), or would the network define a few standard variations to which all of the farmers would comply? Perhaps a good customer base for this would be small and independent coffeeshops & cafs that could consolidate their demands and order higher volumes from the coffee exchange. If the consolidated volumes are high enough to fit a shipping container, the coffee exchange can meet global demands. I wanted to share some thoughts in getting such a concept working. Perhaps the principal challenges of organizing such a network is that participants usually work in a de-centralized, disruptive, and distributed manner.\r\rDe-centralized : large-scale process transformation is usually not possible, as each grower/buyer has their own ways of working, and opportunities like this exchange provide them with spot sales opportunities. The growers usually have fixed price/ fixed term sales at extortionate prices (usually to large buyers and corporates), and are already participating in other processes that constrain them from adopting radical changes in their ways of work. Any working solution to enable them to participate in your network will probably need them to embrace their own ways of working.\r\rDisruptive : Farmers/Buyers need to do lots of things at the same time. And not everything gets finished at one go. There is a tendency to switch back and forth between lots of tasks.\r\rDistributed : Farmers/Buyers tend to be physically distributed with internet connections good and bad. \r\rThe easiest thing to realize in these networks are the online webshop and the online collaborative spaces. It's the real-time stock, consistent and detailed product information, ordering and invoicing, planning, consolidation, packaging, transport, and returns that get tricky. The efficiencies of these processes often underline the success of such collaborative networks.", "user": "5510cb16c54575f90289799f0a853d23", "date": "July 09, 2011, 06:44AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "caldas_coffee_direct_exchange", "applause": 4, "user_url": "", "text": "Awesome!\rThis website was made by a local coffee farmer from Costa Rica to sell his product directly and it is working - http://www.donevelio.com/our-farm.html (there is a CNN video and it is interesting to see...)", "user": "7b76fa6d63e8b83256c530bed4c855e1", "date": "June 28, 2011, 07:53PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "caldas_coffee_direct_exchange", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Perfect find Juan!

Thank you for that. Yes, the kids were talking about tourists in the video, like they are improving the projects for tourists to come, even though the intent is to build a safer neighborhood. \r\rSome thoughts with this project in particular. I was in a talk by Former Mayor of Medellin Sergio Fajardo, he was questioned by the audience where the money of these magnificent, big-scale public projects come from. He noted that Colombian government is fairly centralized and there are quite a few public corporations / industries that are tied to the government. He added that a lot of the budget comes form taxation to both the people and to these corporations. Now, this is my opinion, I would imagine he is under a lot of political pressure that all these money had to be used to not just make a better place for the poorest neighborhoods, that they have to 1. tackle the crime issue; 2. attract foreigners to invest in Medellin, 3. attract tourist at the same time as they solve the problems of Santo Domingo Savio. Not to mention the biggest drive for these project: to make change UNDER one political term which is FOUR YEARS. \r\rGiven this I think there is a lot of reasons for him in particular to be very efficient in the decision of making these construction projects happen at lightning speed for effective results. \r\rNow, that's NOT what I am advocating, and I really think engaging with the community is the basis of all these incremental upgrade projects, from business building to construction to infrastructure, to truly \"listen\" to what they want in their terms.\r\rOne other example of Favela-Barrio upgrade project in Rio:\r\rhttp://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/upgrading/case-examples/ce-BL-fav.html\r\rTo my knowledge involvement of community in this case is also quite an afterthought, and only conducted in an ad-hoc manner during construction (as this is the only time that the communities can see the work), but there are somethings to highlight from Inter-America Development Bank: \"Also important was use of program managers coming from grass-roots infrastructure upgrading efforts in Rio de Janeiro. They know the technical aspects of upgrading and they know the community. They can act as an efficient middle person between the communities and the government.\"\r\rI think penetrating into the community and building relationship is the key.

The bad thing about txt messages is that sometimes it's better for this people to have some pics of how the pill looks like, and therefore a picture may be good to have. Say you are taking 4 meds for Tuberculosis, or 3 for chronic gastritis. What usually happens is that since the names are so uncommon for people, they get the doses mixed up. In those cases, a picture will make a difference. I know many people have the impression \"all pills look the same\" but truth is they don't. Specially on their package. In the US, pills are distributed in this little orange pill containers, but in Colombia, pills are distributed outside the box, but inside the aluminum/plastic container. This things have color codes, and it would be easier for someone to distinguish between Ceritizine and Amoxaciline just by a picture rather than by their names, specially knowing that many times patients get the instructions written by doctors, widely known (I believe) because of their bad writing. \rFinally, creating one app, may cost around 1000USD and then making it available over and over for patients will have no cost. On the side of the text messages, multimedia text messages have a lower cost, but sending say 6 messages a day per patient, for around 3 months will have a much higher cost, for just one patient, than creating one single app. Also I would like to notice that the health care system in Colombia enforce doctors to write the prescriptions with the generic names of the drugs, so they are not allowed to use brand names. This way the local insurance companies (although the system is different than the one of the States) give their patients, usually generic drugs with different brand names, say acetaminophen can be called either \"desenfriolito\" or \"dolex\" but is the same molecule. So, by inviting pharma companies to participate, you jump over the culture and maybe even law, already in place in Colombia. Who is to choose which pharma lab will provide the pill? Because that will increase their revenue.
