The idea could be implemented in both ways.\r\rInitially though as a proof of concept I was thinking more of a game pulling information from your EMP activities. This may to some extent limit who is able to fully utilize the value from such a concept. But again, only if it is implemented into the traditional game platforms which does require quite a bit of interaction and the interest to play such games.\r\rBut Wii or Kinect style of games make it little more flexible and allow to engage non-traditional gamers. \r\rApproaching this concept from the angle of creating an EMP framework which is implemented like a game is a possibility. \r\rIf not in a game format, accumulating points via EMP activities could also be used as a way to avail of benefits at different businesses.

So caretakers in the retirement homes could bring all the members for an evening gathering to play the games on each team's behalf. It could become a fun evening social gathering too.\r\rAs many other inspirations have noted, bringing younger generation to interact with the older generation could be another way to help the older folks to engage in such EMP type games and activities. For the older folks the real aim is to help them lead a more active and healthy life while the real game could be played by people volunteers, etc.\r\rI am sure there might be other way of gamifying such daily activities.

Elderly neighbours of ours frequently meet up for walks together and it is an important social, physical and mental activity for them. I know they would love to expand their group and an idea like this would be perfect.\r\rI was wondering if there is another method of delivery/interactivity other than an app as I know my neighbours do not use smart phones or iPads and would not pick this technology up easily (many of them actually would have problems reading text on these units). I think we need to bear in mind that many of the elderly are really not interested in new technology and ease of use and understanding would really be paramount for this to be successful. Building on an existing and familiar technology may be an effective approach.\r\rI was imagining a watch-like unit linked to a set-top box for their existing television. This would provide a means of organising participants as well as recording activity? Users can turn on their television to a particular channel and then link up and form groups using a standard television/dvd player style remote. Walking times, participants and meeting places can be organised and then this uploads to their watch unit which provides directions etc. The watch unit could also monitor user vitals and have an emergency call trigger in event of heart attack etc. (maybe another call function in case the user becomes disoriented, or injured, and needs to contact a relative).\r\rLove your idea, actually it's very similar to what I was going to post, so I've just added my set-top box idea in this post instead of doubling up and posting my own :)", "user": "4a6c62bc16c6b7330bb6e241df13b445", "date": "July 17, 2013, 01:49AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "walking_to_feeling_good", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for your comment.

Taking in their wisdom. Realizing how much they have to give--even if their health is failing. That life story is like priceless gold.   \r\rBut the key is keeping it SIMPLE.  When a www.lifebio.com can be created in less than 30 minutes, that makes it do-able.   We know that older people might need help getting that story on the web so it can't be too daunting a task for younger volunteers, family, or health care staff members....so making it quick but powerful to bring out the story is our strength.

A good friend of mine a few weeks ago decided with her sister and brother to put their mother (who has dementia) in a nursing home as her sister who lives nearby her mother could not manage it anymore. Moreover, care givers at home were not enough anymore. I know it was hard and part of the difficulty came from the sense of guilt... so clearly thinking of the implications for families matter.\r\rThanks again for sharing!", "user": "893f53c159eab9178ab181bad8da4262", "date": "June 29, 2013, 12:07AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "incentives_for_multi_generational_living", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Thanks for the psychologists validation of my agreed belief that staying at home would be much less expensive...I'll definitely start digging into that.  I was very surprised when my father moved in that medicare would ONLY pay for short-term care-giver support and if you (the family, in my case daughter) wanted to provide that instead, by taking off of work for a period, they would ONLY allow that IF the licensed care-giver both trained you AND was there with you when the support was being provided.  \r\rThis article summarizes the available options pretty well (http://www.caelhealthcare.org/what-senior-care-options-does-medicare-cover/).  I would be over the moon if this challenge collaboration resulted in medicare or medicaid not only supporting but encouraging the 'family as care-giver' payment option.  \r\rEven as much as you love your parent and might consider doing this for love reasons alone, the fact that you have to reduce your hours at work or stop working all-together means that some form of payment is required, and for non-working children of elderly parents (such as stay at home moms) it could provide a sense of value for a needed service being provided, while letting them have a bit of independence about how money is spent in life (ie invest in that new bathroom, or take that trip you'd always wanted to).  \r\rYour point about aging parents with ailments that go well beyond what their children could provide support for is VERY important.  When my dad was at his worst, I tried to do everything, and it was really tearing the family apart, I was exhausted and some of the activities are SO beyond my level of expertise physically (and mentally) that ultimately I pulled the trigger on having someone come in for a few hours a day that knew what they were doing and I had my dad pay for that.  \r\rNow we know our limits, when we need to call in for extra ammunition.  If my father moved into a dementia situation (which I experienced my grandmother go through when I was younger) I can very quickly see how at home care becomes not an option, simply in order to keep the parent safe (I remember as a kid my grandmother started wandering the streets and no one knew where she was).  \r\rI suppose the whole thing is to start talking to your parents early about the options, being honest about when things are beyond your capabilities and agreeing at what stages you'd call someone IN the house to help out...all the way to the serious dementia stages where you'd need to have them in a home or assisted living situation with 24-hour support.  \r\rThe bigger challenge is the financial part and how to change the way medicare/medicaid not only supports but encourages the 'family as care-giver' option. \r\rLove this collaboration :) ", "user": "7f5a4043b41bb2cf6f3dc50d1aeecee7", "date": "June 29, 2013, 09:21PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "incentives_for_multi_generational_living", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Lynn,\rthanks for your reply.

Driving is another big one that is often taken for granted since it happens so often, but driving is inherently very dangerous.\r\rSecond - Patience. This is related to the above, in that when you are helping someone do things they can no longer do, they still want them done their own way. And rightly so. However, this can sometimes be frustrating. Often I found myself thinking that I could perform something quicker if just left to my own devices (I was often wrong, mind you). It takes a lot of patience to listen, and actually hear what is being said, when you disagree. I learned to take a deep breath, and ensure I listened all the way through. Only then would I mention my opinion on the matter. Of course, sometimes it was not worth mentioning.\r\rFinally - Living with your co-workers is hard. No question about it. You are always at work. It can be hard to \"shut off\" in this situation. I found myself getting out of the house as much as I could when not working.

It could be something on a grand scale like, as you suggest, a battle or something family-specific like the birth of a child.

Maybe it has a touch screen and super simple interface with buttons for family, world events, trips, etc. And then maybe it pulls up the testimonial, or pictures, or videos, you entered about that thing 10 years ago along. Maybe, and this is out there, it even has a basic bank of scents (building Tom H's inspiration http://www.openideo.com/open/mayo-clinic/inspiration/smell-a-memory/). So if the memory or event is about the beach, it spritzes a little sea air scent. \r\rI like your idea of sharing the database across different stakeholders too.

I'd really love to create something like this to not just make them feel like they're being useful but to actually make them valuable. \r\rI also agree with your take on the international piece-- it could so easily meld those two important concepts together and be an extremely robust sharing ground for not only history vs. present but also culture and language. \r\rIn the long term I see it as a really cool connector for volunteers and in-person relationships because many seniors would need help navigating and using such a site.

And the mockup is great. \r\rI really like the direction you're going with making it something that can easily be autonomous or done by a \"collector,\" volunteer, or \"ethnographer\" as Joe mentioned. I think it would be rather simple to create an interface that allowed people to 1. share a story 2. simply create a profile with \"tagged\" specialties to be contacted later to actually share the story and 3. have a 3rd party enter profiles and stories for people they're working with. The 3rd part would allow even more to be collected-- seniors who don't have access to computers, don't know how to use them, maybe even aren't very literate or even some who have passed away but had shared such detailed stories with their families that they want to pass them on for use. I love this expansion!\r\rI also meant to respond to your earlier comment about the device. I think it would be really cool to branch this into sort of a \"device\" component that goes with the site/system that is essentially a recording device and can upload stories that way. Sort of like a personal StoryCorps. I don't know if I read it correctly, but the impression I got from your idea would be a device that is originally meant to help the senior by allowing them to search back into specific memories for photos, stories, etc....sort of like an autonomous way to deal with Alzheimer's or other memory issues rather than having to ask their children over and over again? It would be amazing to have something that works both ways-- searchable for them but also have an \"upload option\" (like the Nike+ apps just upload your workout to the site!) for this network. Basically one big time capsule that's useful in the moment and years later. \r\rBack to your screenshot-- I like the simplicity of this model. I was thinking the output-- so the searchable piece-- could look either like a LinkedIn type system where you get matched to people and can connect with them, or something much simpler like a basic academic library system. In the latter, the profile or story would appear just like a book or article title does in those systems based on your search criteria. My original idea was the latter because it makes it more academic/simple to use and less like a social network. I liked the separation of this idea from a social network idea (though I really want to work with the social network concept also posted on this challenge). \r\rI'd love to hear more of your thoughts on this!", "user": "fc259d3e84019521084698faece8820b", "date": "July 09, 2013, 04:17AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "senior_knowledge_bank", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Really nice idea Rachel and great prototype Nick! \rIt helps discussing the interface but also the process.\r\rRachel, I love the idea of an \"academic\" database and as Joe mentioned I think there will be a lot of students who would love it and I think it will also be a very positive experience for elders. I know that my parents and in-laws when my kids reached out to them to ask them questions about the past for their projects. My son also contacted my uncle who is a cardiac surgeon one year ago to ask him to interpret data on blood pressure he had collected for a science project (7th grade). My son was happy to get insights from an expert and mentioned it in his paper. My uncle who lives in Europe while we live in NY and who had never met my son replied very quickly and seemed happy to share his knowledge. \r\rAn extension of this could be mentoring offered by some of the members of this knowledge database:  my dad has become the person to call when there is help needed for maths and physics projects. It has become a joke in the family and my kids love emailing or skyping him (he lives in Paris) and he loves being contacted. \r\rRegarding the memory issues (per Nick's comment and via Tom's suggestion), I am wondering if that would not be another concept or maybe an individual option for members: this database would be useful for people to get back to their memories and when they start forgetting too much, it might be useful for the family to be able to trigger conversation. \r\rWhile your  idea is related to Nick's idea, I agree with you Rachel, that it is better to keep them separated.

They have artist co-ops there, insanely cheap real estate, a supportive arts-friendly mayor, and nearby Pittsburgh is the home of some of the best hospitals and the second most foundation money in the US (which means many more opportunities for funding). The Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon might be an interesting place to look for partners. They have a Masters in Art Management program (nonprofit/public policy degree) where masters students complete capstone projects to graduate along the lines of putting together a business plan for a project like this. \r\rAnother case study to investigate would be the Brew House Artist lofts in Pgh http://pittsburgharts.org/brew-house-association-call-proposals-2013 \r\rDetroit would also be a great location for foundation money and cheap real estate. University of Michigan Ross school of business might be an interesting resource. If you put together a business plan, you might be able to get grad students to champion the project and bring university money for a summer internship project. Ross students have a thriving Net Impact group which focuses on nonprofit and civic community work that you could reach out to.

Although the end goal is pretty much the same, the people decluttering their homes would feel more empowered picking a charity or cause that is special to them and the service would be perceived as more transparent and therefore more trustworthy.

There has been a large number of charities that have come under fire for the way they operate. \r\rSecond, with so much national attention and concern going to elderly people with incomes barely able to cover essentials, why not help these possible \"hoarders\" sell these items to raise money for themselves? Wouldn't that be a better win-win situation?

I think we would need to play through the model a bit more but maybe there could even be a 2-tier version of the service?  For example, the free service could be where the charity gets first refusal on the items as payment for their time or, for a nominal fee, the charity could take responsibility for selling the items and passing the money raised back to the original owner.\r\rI think there are probably smart ways to design out the potential for abuse, e.g. making declutterbugs work in pairs, giving people a cooling off period between the decluttering visit and relinquishing the items, ensuring a member of the family countersigns the inventory etc.  I'm sure there's examples of best practice around in-home services we could refer to here to help guide us but I think reducing the risk of exploitation would have to be the number 1 imperative.\r\rLastly, you're right to flag the important difference between people who need help getting clutter back under control and hoarders with underlying mental health issues.  Training is obviously critical here but a starting litmus test is that hoarders often get very distressed about the prospect of parting with things, whereas people dealing with clutter *want* the stuff gone but feel overwhelmed/don't know where to start.\r\rDeclutterbugs would need to be trained to recognise the distinction and, in the case of a hoarder with underlying mental health issues, notify family, doctors and social services as appropriate.  \r\rThanks for taking the time to offer such constructive feedback.\r\rLydia", "user": "e5da1c40289d2b5455db5f7ee62e5dd0", "date": "July 22, 2013, 12:13PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "declutterbugs_a_win_win_service_for_charities_and_people_unable_to_stay_on_top_of_their_clutter", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Congrats on this post being today's onsite Featured Idea!", "user": "21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3", "date": "July 17, 2013, 08:51PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "declutterbugs_a_win_win_service_for_charities_and_people_unable_to_stay_on_top_of_their_clutter", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Oh wow - thanks very much!  :-)", "user": "e5da1c40289d2b5455db5f7ee62e5dd0", "date": "July 18, 2013, 04:45PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "declutterbugs_a_win_win_service_for_charities_and_people_unable_to_stay_on_top_of_their_clutter", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Just brilliant.

Switching jobs, hoping to find the right job becomes more challenging as the person gets older, making many people settle for the wrong job, awaiting their retirement!  For such people, the knowledge that they gained over the years is actually a burden, that they unconsciously let go after retirement.\r\rOn the other hand, those who have the right job, retirement comes as an unwelcomed guest.  For most people they no longer can use their knowledge, and begin to leak that knowledge with time.  The professor that you mentioned is an example of someone that had an opportunity to prevent the leakage of his knowledge, but I think that this professor represents the lucky few who get the opportunity to maintain their knowledge after retirement.\r\rWe surely need new ideas/concepts to deal with these big issues.

Their story may supply an insight from another perspective related to this concept.\r\rMe and my family, we are living in Istanbul/ Turkey, where people work for long hours and waste so much time on traffic. This means most of the parents can't take care of their children by themselves, here. Even though they can afford a babysitter or a helper; most of them prefer their mothers and fathers to raise up their children - also I should note that people I know who are in their 60's-70's are really energetic and they are still passionate about life.\r\rAunt Nesrin:\r\rNesrin is 66 years old and she helps her doughter to raise up her 3 years old son Demir. Last year, Nesrin was able to go to swim and do pilates in addition to carrying her responsibilities; because a helper was supporting her by sharing some of the house works. After helper had leaved and Demir started to go to a baby day care center -just from 08:00 to 12:00, she gave a break to do sports; because somehow the number of her responsibilities increased.\r\rAunt Nermin:\r\rNermin is 63 years old and she raised up her granddoughter Azra. Nermin was quite busy with Azra when she was a baby. Now, Azra is 8 years old and how they spend their time is quite changed: Nermin goes to sewing and embroidery courses in addition to carrying house works and Azra plays instrument, goes to school. They are still close friends, some nights Azra stays at Nermin and they sleep together :)\r\rSo, my aunts are willing to take care of both themselves and their grandchildren; while they are willing to spend time on other things such as doing sport, sewing, meeting with friends etc. On the other hand, with respect to their age, it is hard for them to synchronize all of these activities without a support.

By way of an answer to OpenIDEO's question below, here are some examples of ways that our montessori pre-school inside a nursing home worked welleven without much direct interaction between the youngers and olders (due to the health concerns). The mixing of the two communities was fostered through such simple day-to-day activities as:\r\r the kids parading through the hallways in their Halloween costumes and for various other celebrations\rjoining in on the various art and craft activities and helping to decorate the hallways and lobby\rparticipating in the perks provided by the nursing home, such as the farmers market (where they would each buy something for the morning snack)\rassisted living folks occasionally volunteered in the pre-school (strikes me this could definitely be furthered in this model as the assisted living folks are generally less vulnerable health-wise)\rthe kids played in the outside play structure in the inner courtyard (much to the delight of the residents)\rschool parties were hosted inside the main community room and courtyard, including music and much loved old favorites \rthe kids were picked up in the main lobby every day at various intervals, which allowed for many natural interactions to occur for both parents and children.\rour whole family ended up becoming good friends with one of the residents in this community and we visited her regularly until she passed away a few years later.

It was really a great experience and I'm lucky that my community was so open to me doing it. These are amazing questions that you have and I think I'll also refine my post further to add some of the answers in. \r\rI learned that the need that I was trying to fill is one that is very important to some. There were a few older adults who loved the idea but did have great relationships with younger generations. However, the majority of the people at the center felt that there was a gap and it was difficult to speak with the younger people in their lives. Many of their comments were expressing that they felt younger generations didn't really want to be part of their lives or didn't have time for them.\r\rIn regards to following up with people, I asked a few of the younger people at the workshop to send me written feedback on how they felt about the experience. I got this response that I posted below in Meena's thread which I thought was really nice. \"When we listed things we remembered from our childhood, my memories and their memories of their own childhood were both rather similar. We tend to think our generations have a \"gap\" of interest but in reality we don't. We are much more closer connected than we think.\" - Erica, 25\r\rI don't know if it will be possible to follow up with these particular new relationships because the people that were interacting together didn't know each other and may not keep in touch. I would hope that their experiences from the workshop would carry out in their personal lives with relationships that they do have. \r\rAs a follow up service, it could be nice to move this to a digital space where people can upload different things they learned through playing the games and share it with a larger community. What do you think of something like this? I think this could also reinforce the lesson because people will be seeing the experiences that others were having and would hopefully re-emphasize the message.\r\rTo see how well the game would spread, I think this might be able to be accomplished with the above idea of a digital space of experiences as well? If it were still in analog form, given away with instructions, I'm not sure how I could measure the impact.

I looked at the writing and thought... wow this stuff is gold! So I asked him if he'd be ok about me setting up a blog for him. He didn't know what that was ;^) We worked together to spilt his writing up into posts (we didn't worry about the order but went more for discreet, engaging stories), I gave them a light edit and a title, we selected photos to go with each piece and over time I uploaded them. It was a total hit, especially posts set in historical India. I promoted it on Twitter and Facebook and before long all sorts of people were reading it (including a Bollywood star and renowned Indian professor) My Dad was completely blown away and it gave him an 'energy injection'  in my mother's words ;^) Unfortunately the blog was on Posterous which has since closed down and I haven't had the chance to migrate it elsewhere. But my big point is that this process really brought us together. I recommended it to a couple of other friends who got their kids to do something similar with their grandparents. \r\rLots of opportunities on this idea, Eugene.

Most of them have been there and done that, experiencing and overcoming tumultuous life challenges with grace.

These snippets could be made social media friendly to facilitate exposure via social media platforms such as Facebook and enabled for downloading at NFC enabled points in public places, allowing for even deeper community penetration.\r\rPeople who download and view these Pick Me Ups will be able to like and share it with friends, and leave comments as per current social media posts. These statistics will be tracked updated to the respective elderly to see how many people they have touched and inspired.\r\rThrough this, social interaction between the community and the elderly as a whole increases and the elderly may enjoy better mental and spiritual well being, seeing that they are able to touch the lives of others through their stories.

Marion and her collaborator, Joanne Roberts have been active in the aging in place' space since 2008.

I think the sense of isolation comes much later in life, if you live long enough and all your friends are gone.

Technology might be part of this rather than a subject unto itself.\r\rCan I go it alone? How do widows and widowers keep movingor falling forward as a friend of mine says. \r\rSomething around resourcefulnesshow can we become more resourceful as we get older.\r\rAll these ideas reflect my belief that one of the hardest things to face as we get older is that our worlds shrinkwhether in the transition of work to retirement, downsizing life, kids moving away, friends moving away, becoming diminished or dying. People don't talk about it muchall of a sudden you realize it's happening.

Pismo Dunes has the advantage of a fair owner and an awesome resident-manager.  Also, access to the beach - residents talk about how lucky they are to have cheap rent near the ocean.  I don't quite know how to turn this idea into a concept, but it interests me, and I was happy to see that there exist organizations that help trailer residents turn their parks into co-ops.

You make a good point. Making the guidelines too strict would certainly create some bitterness on both sides. The reason I thought making it part of the curriculum would be better than making it an extra-curricular activity is that many students from more troubled backgrounds would be much less likely to participate in an extra-curricular activity than a mandatory one. The main mechanism for prevention of bitterness would lie in bringing the right students and seniors together and giving them the creative freedom do something they truly care about. For the students it would an island of creative freedom in an otherwise largely mandated curriculum. While the project itself would be mandatory, its content would not assigned. It would help the students set their own goals. \r\rOf course, even with creative freedom there would still be some students who would not like the idea of a project with \"old people\". That is unavoidable. However, like many things in life the hope would be that despite their initial misgivings if they were able to find something they cared about and someone with whom they could work with to a manageable degree they would learn to see the value in it. The first few years would be the most difficult. Once enough projects were completed and there was some history behind it students might be more inclined to try it. \r\rPerhaps to ease into it the project could start out as a optional class, held during school hours but not mandatory.

I think you hit on an interesting topic here. We came up with a concept in that direction too, but slightly more connected to the real life of these people. And I would like to submit our consideration to strengthen your concept. We talked with many older people and we found an interesting thing, those who live on themselves fear to be taken to an elderly home and those who live in an elderly home often talked about their own place and things. We found there is a very dominant moment occuring when the elder person moves from his/her own house to an elderly home, at that moment many objects, places, memories etc are left behind or even sold/destroyed. People living in their own house have many objects, documents, pictures etc that all convey stories and meaning. The moment of moving is tough partially because you lose all those things, or many of them. Even ones you do not realize you will lose as you move. \r\rWe came up with a suggestion to provide \"elderly moving service\" which does not only relate to the physical moving of stuff but which extends beyond that by providing the service to listen to the stories and record them. The elderly person in that way has a good moment to recap the old stories and record them for later generations and for themselves. In that way the objects that symbolize this person somehow do not disappear completely even though they may leave the live of the elder person.\r\rThe contribution of this is manifold, on the one hand the story could be connected to the object so the new owner of the object would still have the story. Maintaining the long term value of objects. Aside from that the elder person can really say farewell to his objects without losing the quality of them entirely. This according to feedback of elder persons would reduce the pain of moving to some extend. \"the story is told\". Another interesting benefit could be to share these stories, on the one hand this could add value for family of the elder person but it could also be amazing stories to use as inspiration for writing books or movies. These stories are so incredibly rich! We thought of creating an online database of stories. The storytellers could have access to the stories but in anonymous form so the personal details are taken away (names etc) but the quality of the stories are maintained.\r\rWell I think it would be awesome to talk with you about this concept at some point.

Some of the findings or insights (plus personal observations):\r\r* In Turkey, it is almost always (over %95) *women* who take care of the elderly family members at home (where they live together). This is usually the rule, as far as I know, in small towns, in rural areas, in low-income households, and *especially* in the households where women do not work. Traditionally, looking after children and/or the elderly is considered to be a woman's responsibility. This is the traditional \"option\". \r\r* Turkey has changed dramatically in terms of urban population (currently over %75). Institutional care has been gaining more importance in major cities. Although insufficient in number (and perhaps not affordable for many families) there are private and public nursing centers. Although currently very limited in number, there are also day-care centers or social activity clubs for the elderly.\r\rI noticed that a municipality in Turkey provides routine services (cleaning, cooking, personal care, etc.) for the elderly who live alone and who are in need. I also noticed that cleaning (cleaning the apartment, washing dishes, laundry, etc.) is the service with the highest number of request.\r\r* Another trend in major towns in Turkey is to hire a woman (typically, an immigrant worker from Moldovia or Georgia) to take care of the elderly family member in the elderly person's own apartment. This option is considered to be a socially more acceptable one in comparison to the institutional care. However, we can say that this option is not affordable for many families.\r\r* Women's labour force participation is low (%25-28) in Turkey. In conservative sections in particular, women are strongly encouraged to stay at home. The experts are also drawing attention to the fact that the number of (affordable) kindergartens and nursing centres for the elderly are insufficient in Turkey. Very interesting and complex pattern...\r\r* For Turkey, we need to take into account that women care givers may lack technological means and/or skills and/or proper education.", "user": "147d16bdc71d662b873309e878e08b4e", "date": "August 06, 2013, 08:51AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "staying_in_the_loop", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi again Fatma, thanks for your insights from Turkey.

It got me thinking about my grandparents situation, they have very different needs in the same home.\r\rAfter several hip and knee operations my grandfather struggles on the stairs and  sometimes uses walking sticks which is quite dangerous given his range of motion and how narrow the stairs are. They do not own their own home though, it is owned by the local authority, and so their options are limited. They are advised to move their bedroom downstairs into the living room. Incredible. We really need to make things accessible to those without the disposable funds to afford them, and ideally in such a way they can accommodate varying degrees of ability. My grandmother does not need assistance and so moving downstairs seems absurd.\r\rLikewise in the bathroom, they have had the bathroom converted by the local authority into a wet-room for my grandfather (basically a shower in the corner was the only option), but now my gran has no bath to relax in and feels a massive part of her down-time and independence has gone.\r\rI shouldn't think they're alone in ageing at different rates and wanting to stay in the home they've lived in for thirty five years.

The concept of universal design is to make living and work spaces equally comfortable, safe, and accessible for all, regardless of height or physical ability. These follow ideas might help make a home safer for an older resident, but they're pretty smart for homeowners of all ages. \r\rEasy on the Hands \r\rYou probably don't think much about turning a doorknob, but it can actually be quite a chore, even painful, for someone with arthritis or other conditions. Simply replacing doorknobs with lever-style hardware can make life easier for residents. Levers are also best on faucets, and illuminated rocker switches are better than the standard toggle light switches. \r\rFriendly Floors \r\rSlippery surfaces are not the only danger underfoot, although they're the most obvious. All floors should be made slip-resistant, such as by adding nonskid mats under area rugs (or getting rid of the area rugs completely). Trips are as dangerous as slips, so eliminate trip points like thresholds wherever possible, or reduce their height. For those who use walkers, low-pile carpeting is safest so the walker doesn't catch on deep pile and cause a fall. \r\rSafe Stairs \r\rFor older people living on more than one level, stairs can be especially dangerous. Handrails are a must, on both sides of the staircase if possible. Lighting is also critical, so make sure the entire stairway is well lit from top to bottom. Clearly defined steps that show where the edge of the tread is can help prevent falls.\r\rA Well-Lighted Place \r\rThe staircase isn't the only part of a home that needs good lighting. A dark room is an invitation to a bump or a fall, so make sure there's adequate lighting in every room, hallway, and doorway. Entryways are especially dangerous if not well lit. There are new presence sensors or smart bulbs that detect the presence and increase light. \r\rLanding Places\r\rFumbling with keys, packages, the mail  all can distract and unbalance someone entering or exiting a home. In addition to providing lighting at entryways be sure to have a table, bench, or other surface nearby for putting things down.\r\rBetter Baths \r\rMost people think of shower grab bars as the way to make bathing safer. There are other ways to help ensure safety in the bath. Think about adding grab bars by the toilet, too, or other places in the room where someone may need a helping hand. A step-in shower is safer than a tub, but if that's not possible add grab bars that help someone getting in and out. A single-handled faucet control reduces the chances of scalding at the sink, and a pressure-balanced control does the same in the shower. A hand-held showerhead is often easier to use for someone with limited mobility than a fixed showerhead. \r\rThe reason we need to support Universal Design.

Over a half-century later it became evident that no one under the age of sixty-five had any signs of heart disease. This phenomenon became known as the Roseto mystery. \r\rThe outward image of this community, on face value, was not a picture of good health. The men drank beer and wine, smoked cigarettes, and worked long hours in stone quarries with no protection from hazardous materials. Their diet consisted of greasy food fried in lard. Exercise was something they did while at work.  \r\rIt was concluded over years of research and studies that the reason these people were immune to heart disease was due to a strong interpersonal social connection comprised of love, caring, respect, and cooperation, as the main contributing factors to the therapeutic effect of the entire community. It was a community that focused on the family as the center in the social scheme of things, but that focus was expanded to neighbors (as extended family) in the community at large.  From the beginning, a sense of common purpose and the camaraderie among these Italians precluded any embarrassment to the less affluent, and the concern for neighbors ensured that no one was ever abandoned. \r\rSadly, by the year 1965 it appeared that the Roseto community had finally caught up with the rest of the world. There was a newly acquired taste for the materialistic rewards typical of the American dream. Up to this point, the Rosetans restrained their inclination toward material indulgence and maintained in their town the image of  a classless society. As some of the members of the community came into material wealth, they began to move away from the downtown area and into the suburbs. The following was a statement from one housewife, caught up in that movement:\r\rIm sorry we moved. Everything is very modern here, very nice. I have everything I need, except people. When we lived in town, the neighbors were always in my kitchen or I was in theirs. We talked. We knew what was going on there and there was always someone around to help you and to keep you from feeling lonely. I miss that, but I guess I will never go back. \r\rThe nourishment of the human soul comes from a tightly knit social network where people feel close to one another.", "user": "471349215e205f94be20c0f0b9aef5c5", "date": "July 10, 2013, 06:05PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "incorporating_mindfulness_and_meditation_in_our_everyday_lives_and_any_age_1", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "I strongly agree with Karen on this subject.

One day as we were watching TV together, she had a question about Abraham Lincoln's children, so i pulled out my i Pad and to Google it and i handed her the i Pad with pictures of Lincoln's family, and text. It took her a while to get the knack of gently scrolling up & down & sideways with her finger. But what surprised me was that she wasn't excited about this amazing technology. I knew that she loved information...her favorite show was Jeopardy. I also knew that she loved to write letters to her friends via snail mail, so i showed her how to use email on our PC but she simply was not interested. Recently, due to extenuating circumstances, we had to move her into a skilled nursing home in Auburn California. After a few months we visited her and discovered that she was thriving due to her interaction with others in the home. She made lots of friends, playing scrabble and just having conversations. No technology. Just people. And it occurred to me that, for her, human interaction was more important than acquiring knowledge and facts. I guess the moral to this story is that you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make her drink.And, like Ann Homan alluded to in her comments, sometimes it's best to simply learn to enjoy sitting with them.

I too believe a major part of the problem is that there is a disconnect between our grandparents' generation and our generation, and therefore healthy (and valuable) food preparation practices have been lost. The former generation knew how to prepare a meal from the field to the table; they had an interactive understanding of agriculture/gardening. More time was allocated into a weekly schedule to plant, cultivate and reap, and more time was allocated into one's daily schedule to prepare fresh, unprocessed meals. Food preparation was a social activity that bonded family and communities together. That time has now been replaced with TV, microwaves and other individualistic activities. \r\rIronically, you mention your grandmother's biscuits; my great aunt prepared the b.e.s.t. dinner rolls. Yet, her skills have now been lost in the family because everyone now buys packaged rolls. Hence, innovation of the grocery store and packaged goods has disconnected this generation from practices which preserved health from a dietary and social aspect. \r\rSo to answer your question, \"So how might we think like the processed, convenient food manufacturers about healthy food,\" Perhaps it can be attacked from 2 directions. First, educate people about Monsanto -- shine a big spotlight on it's deadly work in the U.S. food industry. Second, take these in-person events and create TV shows (kind of like Dr. Oz), but ones that combine naturopathic and holistic health with cooking and social entertaining. E.g. a group of friends cooking in the kitchen preparing curry dishes explaining that curry may reduce chances of Alzheimer's. But romanticize the shows to draw in viewers with decorative ware, telling funny stories around the table, and interacting with viewers online. Make it look desirable to spend more time preparing natural food.\r\rFinally, pretty much all unnatural, processed food manufacturers advertising on TV in the U.S. are partners with Monsanto, which would make getting sponsorship tough. So perhaps it would be possible to offer discounted advertising to organic food manufacturers and retail organic stores.

For a starter, if you like the Amulyte to work anywhere, it would need either a \"radio\" (3G or similar) or BT4.0 to a smartphone connectivity. A radio needs a good re-chargeable battery (since it would send data on a regular basis (I would not recommend always-on), it might last maybe 2-3 days pending on battery size and data push frequency, but not more) + SIM card(!). The BT4.0 needs a smartphone connected...and hence why having Amulyte  around the neck if you carry a phone around in the first place...\rRelated to buttons for e.g. recording or taking pictures on the side of the Amulyte: I am afraid they will be too small for an elders hand to press... the blue alarm button has the correct size for simple usage... we made for our solution of a smartphone for elderly plenty of usability tests and size really matters ;-)\rLess is more at this stage: Explore as good as possible for whom your solution is really interesting. I am not sure if active aging people are interested as they will find it stigmatizing (integrated into a wrist watch might be acceptable), then again here in Europe you find similar solutions targeted to commercial caregiving organizations that run elderly homes. By the way: for men, they thought of the belt buckle as the best option compared to necklace for women.\rOne way to look at it would be: Could this be a high-prized jewelry with only one function = emergency button?

The technology side of things is definitely something that has taken many hours to design, and a lot of the concerns you brought up are things we have carefully been working through (I've tried to address them below). I started working on this idea with a former classmate of mine (we are both Mechatronics Engineers) and we now have a few other people helping us out with the server side development, hardware design, and embedded systems programming (our latest board revision can be seen here: http://instagram.com/p/b0BBamnEyg/).\r\rAs for keeping it simple to begin with - I agree. Our first version will simply be a mobile pers device with an online portal ideal of active seniors who are now living in retirement communities. I think there is a lot of potential in this specific area which is why we decided to focus on that use case first. I also think that there are a lot of interesting ideas that could be incorporated into this type of a device down the road and I am always up for hearing about what they are, in case something interesting comes up :)\r\rAs for the technology concerns:\r\r1. The Pendant will use an embedded cell module to work over cellular networks (we decided not to use Bluetooth as we didn't want to have a dependency on an external mobile phone being used)\r2. We are running power tests and are targeting a 1 week battery life. The battery will be easily rechargeable by simply placing the device on a charging matt (using induction charging).\r3. We are going to be sending data selectively throughout the day so as to preserve battery life. We are also selecting components based on their power consumption as a key factor.\r4. The device will have a SIM card in it when it ships - we will be able to activate the plan on our end once a user goes through the simple online registration on our site after receiving their device (this will be when they also set up their online portal profile).\r5. The additional buttons would be placed to maximize usability - we have considered designs with the buttons on the side of the pendant so a senior would simply have to squeeze the pendant to activate the second button. Right now this is still in the design phase and it will definitely need to undergo user testing before a final design is selected.\r6. We are targeting seniors homes right now to integrate into their care networks. The negative stigma associate with a PERS device is definitely something we want to try to overcome with this device - I think that design and usability will play a huge factor in that.\r\rThanks for the tip about men preferring a belt buckle! I know that women prefer the pendant because they can tuck it under their blouse and it is unobtrusive, but men don't like that design.\r\rI think the idea of making this a more high-end piece of jewellery with the help button functionality is definitely something that is worth exploring.", "user": "95d61b9fae05a3ee15dca1ecd9e70abd", "date": "July 23, 2013, 04:08AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "amulyte_an_activity_tracking_mobile_emergency_response_system_", "applause": 1, "user_url": "", "text": "Are we talking basically lowjack for seniors?

However, the idea of offering rewards for people to wear their lowjack equipment seems reminiscent to the way we treat animals. We put lowjack in our pets and reward them with treats if they behave. \r\rHow do we address this? Dignity should play a large part in this. I have read quite a few ideas on here that read/feel a lot like humane ways to put horses out to pasture.

It's an additional safety net that provides protection and peace of mind in case of an emergency, allowing people to continue living their lives on their terms. THe main purpose of the device is to be an emergency response system - or an easy to use help button in the case that help is needed.\r\rAs for providing rewards, I see where your concern comes from if you feel like this is comparable to providing rewards to pets for good behaviour - but I can assure you that this is absolutely not the model we are trying to replicate. I think a fundamental difference is that when you reward pets for good behaviour, you are rewarding them for actions that the owner deems are desirable. With a system like Amulyte, the point would be to allow seniors to set their own goals and track and measure themselves against those. They wouldn't be rewarded for simply wearing the device, they would be rewarded for meeting/exceeding goals that are tracked and measured by the device (ie. how active they are in a given week).\r\rThe Nike FitBit is a great example of this. It does a fantastic job of allowing people to set and track their own fitness goals and receive rewards when they meet them (even if it is just gloating rights amongst their friends). \r\rI completely agree with you that dignity should play a huge role in this. That is one of the reasons I am so passionate about creating a PERS device - because I think the ones on the market today do a terrible job at making the person wearing it feel empowered.\r\rThe leash concern is definitely something that we are actively thinking about. Our current proposal is that we do not display the exact location of a person unless an emergency is detected. We can simply display how often they are leaving their house (but not telling anyone where they are going) or just showing how active they are (whether that is walking around in their own home or outside). If there is an emergency then we can show their emergency contacts the specific location so that they can send help.", "user": "95d61b9fae05a3ee15dca1ecd9e70abd", "date": "July 23, 2013, 03:50AM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "amulyte_an_activity_tracking_mobile_emergency_response_system_", "applause": 3, "user_url": "", "text": "Love the concept!

A few ideas that I came up with were:\r\r1. For retirement homes you could mount an iPad or other tablet on the wall and have the app pre-loaded and always running on it. There would be a list of names on the left in a column, and tapping on a name would open the corresponding profile on the right hand side of the screen. This would make it easy for seniors to check on how they are doing (activity level, etc.) and we could design the entire experience end-to-end. The tablet could be mounted in a public space: dining hall, games room, etc.\r\r2. Mail a weekly newsletter to the seniors home each week with an update on their stats from the week.\r\r3. Create a web app and an accompanying tutorial that a caregiver could walk a senior through on their own computer. (side note: My grandmother has a computer and internet set up in her own home. I set up her computer so that as soon as she launches a browser her email will open up. I allowed her browser to remember her password so that she doesn't need to sign in. I also installed Skype and set it up so that it automatically signs in and starts up when a computer is started. Getting the right configuration has made it possible for her to easily use her computer to stay connected).\r\r4. Create a downloadable app that could be easily launched from the desktop of a computer. We would also include easy to follow instructions on how to set it up and access it.

Heart rate, galvanic skin response and body temperature are the three next sensors that we want to incorporate.\r\rAnother angle we are looking into is being able to pair additional devices with the Pendant. Because the pendant is cell enabled it is able to transmit data in real time.

For example, what if you want to switch off your pacemaker after suffering for a long time?

How might we bring sociability into their homes through technology or carefully building mini communities around them rather than thrusting strangers into their homes as the quick fix? \r2. I think trying to sustain a sense of usefulness is key to keeping the mind sharp - 'Granny Cloud' is an interesting inspiration as is 'The Amazings' and U3A. But I worry that these cater more for active retirees and there's a layer of the lonely that might struggle with these wonderful services through sheer fragility and tech know-how. How can we create more opportunities for the elderly to be purposeful with major tech and mobility constraints?\r3. Meaningful interactions - part of the challenge lies in really stimulating folks who might be hard of hearing or their visibility might be low or they might be a little vague or forgetful.

There were two of my aunts also interested in the subject, one on either side of my family, and had provided a good start in delving into the family shrub.\rMy grandpa, the only one I knew, was my mother's father and came from a family that embraced photography from early on. The earliest photo I have is one of his parents taken in 1848. Since then, I've made attempts to identify the people in several albums of cabinet photos and snapshots taken by my grandpa and his family. There are several hundred that date to my early years in the thirties. Unfortunately, photography as a regular part of our activities lagged for 25 years, with only occasional snapshots over that period. When I got my first 35mm camera, I started up on my own. Now, with digital cameras and phone cameras, there are more pictures than I can put to use.\r\rSince I do have Photoshop skills and have connected with distant cousins with images, I have acquired even more images-oil portraits of family patriarchs going back to the 18th and early 19th centuries, not to mention the snapshot albums that these cousins have dug up and scanned.\r\rI've tried a couple of approaches to making our family history accessible to anyone interested, simplifying and concentrating the information to  limited genealogical lines. As a designer, I found myself perhaps overdoing things graphically and making each page too labor intensive and perhaps not informative enough. There are applications that I've explored, scrapbooking and one that is available for Macs called \"Pages\" which might be better-certainly easier for my floundering brain than \"InDesign\". Genealogy apps seem to be better suited to documents and lists than for organizing images. \r\rThe image shown in your example intrigue me in that the history of a family is seen in a single image, making it easy to see where the author comes from and easy to show others in a way that doesn't bore them.", "user": "b95bac49c63e9d8fd3a6795bcde40b3f", "date": "June 15, 2013, 06:33PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "generations_roots_layers_", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Awesome to hear that this will inspire your awesome endeavours, Andy.

I feel that mobility devices should have a quality of joy inherent in them, so that when children see them they want to jump onto them to play. Design could replace a lack of dignity with pride. There is also a long way to go in terms of the functionality of current mobility devices, because ergonomics is married to design. Without refined design, feedback from human experience isn't factored in and the broader application possibilities go unexplored. \r\rAnother idea is that I expect there soon to be substantial shifts in the demands for these types of products.

I think it needs focus, clarity and a choice on what is vs. is not part of the matchmaking experience. For example, based on what I think would be compelling to Sages (the driver of success in my opinion), I think eXchange should focus only on their knowledge and that's it. Leave the sharing of data and information to other social spaces. The implication on this choice is that you may have the same categories listed above but now the content is specific and focused and makes the types of platform services much easier to determine.\r\rF) Circling back to some questions you posed previously and recvd some answers:\rYou-> Is there an entirely different approach to the same goal? How might we find a way, using existing platforms or another method, to enable different generations to exchange expertise and abilities?\"\rMe -> Depending on above, you could re-use existing social platforms to run a pilot then eventually build custom.\r\rYou->1) what's the right platform? Is this maybe something built on top of Facebook? Or something new entirely? Or not a social platform at all?\rMe -> See above\r\rYou->2) How do we continue to refine and simplify?

I suppose the major difference between older (read, pre-1929 which was a huge year for speculative building, sort of like the building bubble of the last decade) homes and today's houses is that those houses were built and purchased to be lived in over one's entire life. My grandfather was over 6 feet tall (a giant in his day) and he built his house with door knobs high enough for him to reach comfortably (as children we had to stretch to open a door) and my grandmother's countertops were at kitchen table height, which suited her much shorter frame. No builder would do that today (except when building a custom home) and Realtors advise people to \"go generic\" in design and dcor in order to attract the widest number of potential buyers when they sell. (How many of us spend 30 years with countertops at an uncomfortable height just in case we want to sell someday?) Myths about resale prospects probably drive a lot of our building practices.\rThat said, your toolkit idea is intriguing. An adaptability toolkit could be offered online that people could use to calculate how adaptable their own house, or one they're contemplating buying, is -- sort of like the online calculators that let you learn your body mass index or to calculate compound interest. (Such a toolkit app could be configured by professionals in the industry, such as Seattle architects Karen Braitmayer and Carol Sundstrom who do walk-throughs with clients who want to know if a house they are thinking of buying can be adapted in future.) \rAnother use of such a toolkit: A little box describing possible future uses for a home's spaces would make a great addition to the individual plans offered in all those floor plan books sold at Home Depot and Lowe's.", "user": "d3f9b4f296ab98ac8dfa6e90db50639e", "date": "July 22, 2013, 07:52PM", "sub_comments": {"py/id": 4}}, {"py/object": "classes.Comment", "node": "make_accessibility_the_default_in_building", "applause": 0, "user_url": "", "text": "Hi Lynette, great ideas. \rI also thought about workers' settlement in the Ruhr area in Germany.

Obviously, one, or 10, or 1000 affluent couples building 5,000 sf houses to be age-friendly isn't going to change the culture of American home building. Both the concept of building for all ages and abilities, and the designs and materials to do so, must become mainstream. The National Association of Home Builders CAPS program certifies contractors and is having some success in the remodeling realm, and certain manufacturers of appliances, plumbing fixtures and hardware have added products meant to be age- and user-friendly, but these have been marketed separately from the mainstream -- read, sexier -- products. Until aging and varying physical and mental abilities are divorced from being simply healthcare issues, we will continue to see discrimination against incorporating Universal Design into everyday life and construction. The newly formed Better Living Design Institute -- http://www.betterlivingdesign.org/ -- says it is working with leading trade organizations to develop a program to educate (and offer a BLD Certification to) builders, remodelers and designers trained in \"the principles of Better Living Design and the criteria associated with the 'BLD Approved' designation.\" The idea is to change the perception of UD from \"handicapped accessible\" to design that works for all users -- and is attractive to boot. But, at this point, there is not any assurance that BLD will be any more successful than the NAHB's CAPS program has been in getting consumers to buy into the principles of UD.\rAll that said, I think we need a national campaign, sponsored by manufacturers such as Kohler and Miele and championed by sexy Hollywood types such as George Clooney and Julia Roberts, to condemn user-unfriendly building as outdated thinking and promote attractive, well-designed building methods and products as the wave of the future. Borrow from the AIDS education (\"Not getting tested is not sexy\") and green building movements (LEEDS has been a huge success) with billboards, bus placards, mobile apps and Internet ads touting this. Get smart magazines such as Dwell to profile more UD buildings without simply calling them UD. (Maybe Michael Bloomberg needs another campaign to lead?)\rAs the \"grab bars mean I'm old\" stigma recedes,  manufacturers will be able to add more well-designed products and fixtures and include them in the main parts of their catalogues and showrooms, rather than segregated in \"Home Care\" (Lowe's) sections, because, as the idea of good design goes mainstream, sales of these products will burgeon and allow their prices to come down. Take a tip from Target which found that it could offer well-designed products from Michael Graves and Missoni at prices anyone could afford. OXO doesn't sell its user-friendly housewares as \"accessibility aids\" though that is exactly what they are. (Indeed, OXO is so successful that they can now come out and call their products \"tools you hold onto.\")\rBuilders who now say \"no one wants this\" will fall into line, and houses will simply become more user-friendly (no more needlessly stepped-down family rooms!) even if they aren't advertised as UD or homes for \"aging in place.\"\rA decade ago, sustainable building was something environmentalists did -- and it cost a lot more than conventional building. Today, such building practices have become widely accepted, and less expensive.

The goal of it is to change areas of your brain over time to handle the skills of speed, attention, flexibility, etc more effectively. Just like when you do a physical work out one begins to notice the muscle definition over time, these mental work outs are designed to do the same as well. There is some very interesting scientific evidence available on the site and on going research projects.\r\rI am sure each one of us with our different work requirements use our mental abilities differently and need more of one area than the other. As an innovator, for you \"flexibility\" and \"problem solving\" would be the top areas, just as they were for me when I was a researcher. But we probably apply them differently. Each of those skill areas are not independent of the other and hence developing all areas never hurts and only enhances the other.\r\rI do sense a change in my overall performance. More importantly i think it is a feeling one gets from having a habit (like one person posted about creating awesome habits) and doing something to constantly improve yourself adds to the affect. \r\rJust like one feels good after a physical work out, I think it is the same after a mental work out.
